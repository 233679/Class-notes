# Molecular Kinetic Theory
[[Unsorted/Molecular Kinetic Theory|Kinetic Theory]] only applies to ideal gasses.
### Assumptions
When using [[Unsorted/Molecular Kinetic Theory|Kinetic Theory]], a set of eight assumptions must be made. At least three of these must be memorised
- An ideal gas consists of a collection of small, hard **identical**, spherical particles/molecules.
- The molecules move in random directions and with speeds **distributed** about a mean speed.
( Both above proved by [[Unsorted/Brownian Motion|Brownian Motion]])
- $V_{molecules} < V_{container}$ : The volume of the molecules is much less than the volume of the container
- $T_{duration} < T_{between}$ : The time during collisions is much less than the time between collisions
- All collisions are **elastic** ($E_k$ conserved) & frictionless.
There are two types of collisions.
Particle - particle : between two particles
Particle - wall : between a particle & a wall of the container
- The molecules obey Newtons laws of motion
- The only force acting on the molecules are due to collisions.
- Gravitational & intermolecular forces are negligible to the particles.
The above two assumptions allow $F = \frac{m\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ to be used.

### Derivation (pt1)
Derivation of: $pV = \frac{1}{3}Nm(c_{rms})^2$

p = [[Unsorted/Pascals|Pascals]]
V = Volume (m$^3$)
N = number of molecules
m = Mass of an individual particle
$C_{rms}$ = root mean square speed.
(rms = root mean square)
Aka:
(v & C are use interchangeably)
$\overline{E_k} = \overline{\frac{1}{2}mv^2}$
Since m & 1/2 are constant:
$\overline{E_k} = \frac{1}{2}m\overline{v^2}$
