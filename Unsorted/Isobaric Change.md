# Isobaric Change
[[Unsorted/Isobaric Change|Isobaric Change]] is any change at a constant pressure.

To keep the pressure constant, if the volume of the gas is changing, energy must be transferred to a gas. This can be expressed by the formula:
Work done = $p\Delta V$
$p$ = [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]]
$V$ = Volume
