# Diffraction Patterns
When there is "more" [[Unsorted/Diffraction|Diffraction]] the pattern of lines/rings get closer together.
When there is "less" [[Unsorted/Diffraction|Diffraction]] the pattern of lines/rings get further apart.

- The higher the energy the more diffraction occurs.
- The higher the [[Physics/Momentum|Momentum]], the more diffraction occurs.
- The lower the [[Physics/Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]], the less diffraction occurs.
