# Conduction Electron
[[Unsorted/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electrons]] move about at random within a [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]], with its [[Unsorted/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] depending on the temperature of the [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]].
Similar to a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoemissive Surface|Photoemissive Surface]], [[Unsorted/Metal|Metals]] have a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]], which is about the [[Unsorted/Order Of Magnitude|Order Of Magnitude]] of $10^{-19}$[[Physics/Joules|Joules]]. When a [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]] is at 300[[Unsorted/Kelvin|Kelvin]] the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]] of [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]] is about 20 times greater than the [[Unsorted/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] of the [[Unsorted/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]].
If a [[Unsorted/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]] is [[Physics/Incident|Incident]] to a [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]], that is above the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Threshold Frequency|Threshold Frequency]], then the [[Unsorted/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]] will get released from the [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]] & become a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectron|Photoelectron]]. If energy of the [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] is bellow the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]], then the [[Unsorted/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]] will stay within the [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]] & quickly lose its extra energy via collisions with other sub-atomic particles.
