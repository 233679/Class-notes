The [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]] of a gas is the force per unit area that the gas exerts on its pressure vestal. [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]] is measured in [[Unsorted/Pascals|Pascals]] (Pa). The [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]] of a gas is dependent on the temperature of the gas, the volume of the gas, & the mass of the gas.
