# Charles Law
[[Unsorted/Charles law|Charles law]] determines the relationship for how a fixed mass of gas varies in volume given a variable temperature. To find this relationship, you can contain a suitable dry gas inside a sealed container & measure the volume of the gas at 0C & at 100C.

Plotting this on a graph reveals why [[Physics/Thermal/Absolute Zero|Absolute Zero]] exists. At 0K every gas has 0 volume!

This is [[Unsorted/Isobaric Change|Isobaric Change]].

The formula for [[Unsorted/Charles law|Charles law]] is:
$\frac{V}{T} =$ constant

$V$ = volume
$T$ = temperature (in [[Physics/Thermal/Kelvin|Kelvin]])
