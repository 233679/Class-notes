# Mole
A mole is

$Nk  = nR$
$N$ = Number of molecules
$k$ = [[Unsorted/Boltzmann Constant|Boltzmann Constant]]
$n$ = number of moles
$R$ = [[Unsorted/Molar Gas Constant|Molar Gas Constant]]

---

$N = n\times N_a$
$Na$ - [[Unsorted/Avogadro's Constant|Avogadro's Constant]]

$n = \frac{m}{M_r}$
$M_r$ = relative formula mass.
