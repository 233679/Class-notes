## 1
A hand pump of volume 2.0$\times10^{-4}$m$^3$ is used to force air through a valve into a container of volume 8.0$\times10^{-4}$m$^3$ which contains air at an initial pressure of 101kPa. Calculate the pressure of the air in the container after one stroke of the pump, assuming the temperature is unchanged.

?
$x = p/V = \frac{101000}{8.0\times10^{-4}} = 126250000$
$p = xV = (8.0\times10^{-4} + 2.0\times10^{-4})\times126250000 = 126250$Pa
## 2
A sealed can of fixed volume contains air at a pressure of 101kPa at 100$\degree$C. The can is cooled to a temperature of 20$\degree$C. Calculate the pressure of the air in the can.

$x = p/T = 101000/100 = 1010$
$p = xT = 1010\times 20 = 20200$Pa

## 3
The volume of a fixed mass of gas at 15$\degree$C was 0.085m$^3$. The gas was then heated to 55$\degree$C without a change in pressure. Calculate the new volume of this gas.

$x = \frac{V}{T} = \frac{0.085}{15} = 0.00566666â€¦$
$V = xT = \frac{0.085}{15}\times 55 = 0.31$m$^3$

## 4
A hand pump was used to raise the pressure of the air flask of volume 1.20$\times10^{-4}$m$^3$, without and then with powder in the flask.
- Without the powder in the flask, the pressure increased from 110kPa to 135kPa.
- With 0.038kg of powder in the flask, the pressure increased from 110kPa to 141kPa.

### A
Demonstrate that the volume of air in the hand pump initially was 2.7$\times10^{-5}$m$^3$.

?
The volume doesn't change, however the mass does & I'm not given that?

### B
Error carried forwards.
