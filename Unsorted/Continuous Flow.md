# Continuous Flow
Moving a fluid at a constant rate over a heater (typically in a tube) can be used to determine the [[Unsorted/Specific Heat Capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]] of a fluid. The experiment can be repeated twice, so the heat loss can be eliminated from the calculations.

To measure the change in temperature of the fluid, two thermometers can be put on either end of the tube, using $\Delta\theta$ = T$_1$ - T$_2$ to find the change in temperature. $m_1$ is the the mass of the fluid that flows though the tube during the first experiment, lasting for t$_1$ seconds. With m$_2$ & t$_2$ being the respective values for the second experiment. The power of the heater must be changed until the temperature difference ($\Delta\theta$) is equal to the first experiment. Assuming that the energy dissipation is equal in both experiments, the [[Unsorted/Specific Heat Capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]] can then be calculated.
