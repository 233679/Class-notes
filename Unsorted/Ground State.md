# Ground State
When [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]] are at rest, they are said to be in the [[Unsorted/Ground State|Ground State]], this is where all the [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are in the [[Unsorted/Shell|Shells]] closest to the [[Unsorted/Nucleus|Nucleus]]. This is the least possible energy an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] can have.
