# Shell
While in an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]], [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are bound to discrete "[[Unsorted/Shell|Shells]]"/"orbits"/"energy levels" via the [[Physics/Electrostatic|Electrostatic]] force from the [[Unsorted/Nucleus|Nucleus]]. With the [[Unsorted/Shell|Shells]] closer to the [[Unsorted/Nucleus|Nucleus]] having less energy & the shells further away [[Unsorted/Shell|Shells]] more energy. When staying in the same [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]], [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] have a constant energy. Furthermore, each shell has a maximum amount of [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] that it can contain, if this limit is reached, then [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] will occupy the [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]] with the next highest energy level.
