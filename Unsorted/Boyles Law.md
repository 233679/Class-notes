# Boyles Law
Boyles law states how [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]] varies with volume when the mass and temperature remain constant. This is given by the formula "$pV =$ constant" where:
$p$ = [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]]
$V$ = Volume

[[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] can be investigated using a volume scale containing a gas under a pressure, attached to a pressure gauge, where the pressure can be adjusted.

[[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] measurements plotted as a graph:

The graph will contain a straight line through the origin, if plotted against $\frac{1}{volume}$, as the formula for [[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] can be converted into $y = mx+c$ for a linear graph.
