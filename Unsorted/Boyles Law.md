# Boyles Law
[[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] is the formula:
$pV =$ constant

$p$ = [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]]
$V$ = Volume

This applies for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature.

[[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] can be measured using the apparatus bellow.

[[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] measurements plotted as a graph:

The graph will contain a straight line through the origin, if plotted against $\frac{1}{volume}$, as the formula for [[Unsorted/Boyles Law|Boyles Law]] can be converted into $y = mx+c$ for a linear graph.
