# Fluorescent Tube
The [[Unsorted/Fluorescent Tube|Fluorescent Tube]] is a glass tube, covered with a fluorescent coating internally, whilst containing mercury vapour at a low pressure.
To use the [[Unsorted/Fluorescent Tube|Tube]], connect it in a [[Physics/Electricity/Circuit|Circuit]], as shown bellow:

When the [[Physics/Electricity/Circuit|Circuit]] is connected, the [[Unsorted/Fluorescent Tube|Fluorescent Tube]] will glow, this is because:
- The mercury [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]] in the [[Unsorted/Fluorescent Tube|Tube]] are colliding with each other and the [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]], causing [[Physics/Particles/Ionisation|Ionisation]] & [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excitation]] to occur.
- After the mercury [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]] have been [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excited]], they [[Unsorted/De-Excitation|De-Excite]] into a mix of [[Physics/Light/Ultra Violet|Ultra Violet]] & visible [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photons]].
- The [[Physics/Light/Ultra Violet|Ultra Violet]] [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photons]] released collide with the fluorescent coating inside the [[Unsorted/Fluorescent Tube|Tube]], causing [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excitation]] within those [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]].
- The coating [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]], then also [[Unsorted/De-Excitation|De-Excite]] in steps, releasing even more visible [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photons]],
