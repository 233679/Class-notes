# Pressure Law
The [[Unsorted/Pressure Law|Pressure Law]] governs how the [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]] of a gas changes as a fixed volume with varying temperature.
To find the [[Unsorted/Pressure Law|Pressure Law]] you can perform an experiment with the equipment shown bellow:

Measuring the pressure at different temperatures. Doing so will produce a straight line graph through the origin.

This produces the formula:
$\frac{p}{T} =$ constant

$p$ = [[Unsorted/Pressure|Pressure]]
$T$ = temperature (in [[Physics/Thermal/Kelvin|Kelvin]])
