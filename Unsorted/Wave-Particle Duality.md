# Wave-Particle Duality
The evidence for the particle-like nature of [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] is that [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are deflected by a magnetic field.
The evidence for the wave-like nature of [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] is that [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] experience [[Physics/Waves/Destructive Interference|Destructive Interference]] & [[Physics/Waves/Constructive Interference|Constructive Interference]].
