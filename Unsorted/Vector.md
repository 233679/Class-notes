# Vector
A [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]] is any physical quantity that has a direction & magnitude. An example of a [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]], is a distance in a constant direction ([[Unsorted/Displacement|Displacement]]).

### As Arrows
Any [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]] can be represented as an arrow on a [[Unsorted/Map Diagram|Map Diagram]] or [[Unsorted/Scale Diagram|Scale Diagram]]. With, the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]], & the direction representing the direction of the [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]].

### Resultant Vector
Any two [[Unsorted/Vector|Vectors]], that are the same type, can be combined using a [[Unsorted/Scale Diagram|Scale Diagram]].
