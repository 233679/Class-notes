# Vector
A [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]] is any physical quantity that has a direction & magnitude. An example of a [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]], is a distance in a constant direction ([[Unsorted/Displacement|Displacement]]).

### As Arrows
Any [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]] can be represented as an arrow on a [[Unsorted/Map Diagram|Map Diagram]] or [[Unsorted/Scale Diagram|Scale Diagram]]. With, the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]], & the direction representing the direction of the [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]].

### Resultant Vector
Any two [[Unsorted/Vector|Vectors]], that are the same type, can be combined on a [[Unsorted/Scale Diagram|Scale Diagram]], with [[Unsorted/Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] or pythagoras, to get the resultant [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]].

Example:

![[Attachments/Resultant-Vector-Example.png]]
$Sin = \frac{O}{H}$
$Sin \times H = O$
$Sin(20) \times 8 = 2.7$kN
$2.7 \times 2 = 5.2$kN

For this example the above result is doubled, as there are two [[Unsorted/Vector|Vectors]] of the same magnitude, pulling the circle at an angle opposite to the other.

Example for two perpendicular vectors:

To find the resultant [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]], Pythagoras can be used.

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
$c = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{8^2+4^2} = 8.9$kn

However, if the two [[Unsorted/Vector|Vectors]] are at 0 or 180 from each other the magnitude of each [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]] is summed up
