# EMF
[[Unsorted/EMF|EMF]] is the electrical energy produced per unit charge passing through a source.

[[Unsorted/EMF|EMF]] is measured in [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Volts]], & is represented by the symbol $\epsilon$.

The electrical energy produced when a charge of $Q$ passes through a source = $Q\epsilon$.
