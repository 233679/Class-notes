# Vacuum Photocell
A [[Unsorted/Vacuum Photocell|Vacuum Photocell]] is an enclosed glass tube, containing a [[Unsorted/Metal|Metal]] plate as a [[Unsorted/Cathode|Cathode]] (Referred to as the photocathode), & a smaller electrode as an [[Unsorted/Anode|Anode]].

A [[Unsorted/Vacuum Photocell|Vacuum Photocell]] can be used in a [[Unsorted/Circuit|Circuit]] to detect the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectric Effect|Photoelectric Effect]]. When light, with energy above the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]] is [[Physics/Incident|Incident]] to the photocathode, the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectric Effect|Photoelectric Effect]] will occur, releasing [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] that are attracted to the [[Unsorted/Anode|Anode]], creating a current. This current can be detected by an [[Unsorted/Ammeter|Ammeter]].
An example circuit is shown bellow:

The [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectron|Photoelectrons]] per second is equal to the photoelectric current divided by the charge of an [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]].
Or: photoelectrons per second = $\frac{I}{e}$

The photoelectric [[Unsorted/Current|Current]] created by this [[Unsorted/Circuit|Circuit]] is proportional to the [[Physics/Intensity|Intensity]] of the [[Physics/Incident|Incident]] light.
