Don't write down "Rate" as it's not a unit that is used. Instead use the mass & time (if no time is given use one second).

The change in temperature during run A & run B needs to be identical
### Run A:

##### Units:
$\Delta\theta_A = \theta_2 - \theta_1$ = 10$\degree$C
m$_A$ = 0.0012kg
t = 1s
c = ?

E = P$\times$t = $I\times V\times t$ = $I\times V$ 
(only I V as t = 1)
=> E$_A$ = 27.6J = $12 \times 2.3$

$E_A = mc\Delta\theta + E_{lost}$s

### Run B:
$\Delta\theta_B = \theta_2 - \theta_1$ = 10$\degree$C
m$_B$ = 0.0012kg
t = 1s
c = ?

E$_B$ = 27.6J = $6.0 \times 1.5$

#### Simultaneous Equation:
$E_A - E_B = (m_A - m_B)c\Delta\theta$
$c = \frac{E_A - E_B}{(m_A - m_B)\Delta\theta}$
