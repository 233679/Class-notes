# De-Excitation
When an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] is moved out of its [[Unsorted/Ground State|Ground State]] from [[Physics/Practice/Excitation|Excitation]], it becomes inherently unstable. The [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] moved to the outer [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]] will randomly (over a very small time scale) transfer back to the inner [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]], releasing a [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] in the process, with the [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] emitted having the same energy as the **excitation level** that the [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] was originally transferred to. This can be expressed as this formula:

energy of the photon $= E_1 - E_2$
$E_1$ = higher energy [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]]
$E_2$ = lower energy [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]]

If the [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] was transferred by more than one [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]] it can transfer back to the inner [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]] in any increments. This will release multiple [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photons]] who's energy sums up to give the total energy.
This can be seen by using a [[Unsorted/Fluorescent Tube|Fluorescent Tube]].
