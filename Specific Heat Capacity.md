# Specific Heat Capacity

The **specific** in [[Specific Heat Capacity]] means **per unit mass**. E.G kg.
The formula for [[Specific Heat Capacity]] is:
$Q = mc\Delta \theta$

$Q$ = [[Energy Transferred]] (in [[Physics/Joules|Joule]])
$m$ = Mass
$c$ = [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
$\Delta\theta$ = Change in temperature
