# Floating Point
Floating point numbers are a method of storing the value of binary numbers using standard form.
The exam will use floating point numbers with the last four bits as the exponent.

### Benefits
It allows for a larger range of values.
Allowing for small values to be precise, whilst still allowing larger, but less accurate, values

### Normalisation
A floating point number is normalised if the first two values of the number pass an XOR condition.

#### Benefits
Normalisation ensure that there is only one valid representation of a floating point number.
It also ensure the maximum level of precession for a given number of bits.

For marks:
- Ensure that the exponent value is clearly annotated as "exponent = $x$"
- Ensure that the moved binary point is clear
