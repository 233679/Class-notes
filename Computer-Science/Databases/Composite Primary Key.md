# Composite Primary Key
A [[Computer-Science/Databases/Composite Primary Key|Composite Primary Key]] is type of [[Computer-Science/Databases/Primary Key|Primary Key]] that can be used in [[Computer-Science/Databases/Splitting Table|Splitting Tables]], where the [[Computer-Science/Databases/Primary Key|Primary Key]] of the [[Computer-Science/Databases/Splitting Table|Splitting Table]] is derived from the [[Computer-Science/Databases/Primary Key|Primary Keys]] of the related tables. It is often better to generate a unique [[Computer-Science/Databases/Primary Key|Primary Key]] for the [[Computer-Science/Databases/Splitting Table|Splitting Table]] rather than using a [[Computer-Science/Databases/Composite Primary Key|Composite Primary Key]].
