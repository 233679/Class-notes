# Spiral Model

The Spiral Modlel is made up of four basic steps:
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation (i.e programming & testing)
- Evaluation
These four phases are repeated indefinably, continuously producing different prototypes. This continues until the requirements are met.

### Advantages
- Well defined steps make it easy to manage.
- Software is produced at an early stage.
- The user can give feedback early.
- Extra functionality can easily be added.
- Result is more likely to be appealing to the end user.

### Disadvantages
- The entire process is very time consuming makes the product take longer to finish.
- More costly because of the extra time.
- Not suitable for smaller projects.

### Use case
- Medium to high-risk projects.
- Users are unsure of the possibilities & their needs.
- Complex requirements.
- For large projects that can take years to develop.
