# Rapid Application Development
RAD (Rapid Application Development) is focused on prototyping & rapid feedback, this allows for software to be produced quickly under strict deadlines.
It defines a core cycle of:
- Prototype
- Test
- Refine
Which repeats until the requirements are satisfied.

### Advantages
- Application development.
- Can start with vague/broad requirements.
- Will constantly deliver new software from an early stage.
- Utilizes early & constant feedback throughout development.
- Can produce software quickly.

### Disadvantages
- Clients might not be able to provide constant feedback.
- Automated development tools can require upfront costs.
- Cannot scale well for larger projects.
- Rapid iteration can result in constant reworking of existing code.

### Use Case
- Developing Prototypes.
- When the product is needed as soon as possible.
- When the prototypes can be clearly tested.
- Medium sized projects.
