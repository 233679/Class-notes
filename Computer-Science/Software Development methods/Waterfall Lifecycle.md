# Waterfall Lifecycle
The waterfall method is where you:
- Analysis
- Design
- Implement
- Evaluate
- Maintain
in that order exact order, without going back to previous stages. This can be problematic when needing to go back to previous stage(s), as this is costly & time consuming.

### Advantages
- Very simple to understand & use.
- Each stage is separate & self-contained.
- Makes the project easier to manage.
- Works well for small projects with unchanging requirements.

### Disadvantages
- Not much user involvement after the analysis stage.
- No software is produced until late into the cycle.
- Too late to make changes once the cycle has finished.

### Use case
- Requirements are very clear & fixed.
- No ambiguous requirements.
- Technology is well understood.
- The project is short.
