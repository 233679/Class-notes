# Agile
An Agile mythology allows for continuous iterative development, with each iteration being tested & building upon the last. Whilst getting constant user feedback.
This is achieved by following the core quick loop of "Plan -> Design -> Implement -> Evaluate -> Maintain".

### Advantages
- Software being delivered rapidly & continuously increases customer satisfaction.
- Everyone involved in the process interact with each other constantly. (i.e users, developers, & testers).
- Working software is delivered often.
- Adapting to changing circumstances is easy.
- Late changes in requirements can be implemented.

### Disadvantages
- Lack of emphasis on necessary documentation & design.
- The project can fail to deliver if the customer is not clear about their desired finial outcome.
- Can be too complicated for novice programmers.

### Use case
- When changes can be implemented in small increments.
- When the requirements are constantly changing & developing.
