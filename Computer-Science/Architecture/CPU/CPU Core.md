# CPU Core
A [CPU](Computer-Science/Architecture/CPU/CPU.md) can have multiple cores. Cores each contain the basic functions used in a [CPU](Computer-Science/Architecture/CPU/CPU.md) such as an [ALU](ALU.md) & [Register](Computer-Science/Architecture/Register.md). This allows [CPUs](Computer-Science/Architecture/CPU/CPU.md) with multiple cores to execute operations in [Parallel](Computer-Science/Parallel.md).
