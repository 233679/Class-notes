# Memory
[Memory](Memory.md) is where all the instructions & data is stored. While being used data is usually stored in [RAM](RAM.md), or if it's the current thing being executed it might be located in the [CPU Cache](CPU%20Cache.md) or a [Register](Register.md) inside the [CPU](CPU.md).
Data stored in [Memory](Memory.md) can be accessed by sending a [Memory Address](Memory%20Address.md) on the [Address Bus](Address%20Bus.md) & the stored [Word](Word.md) will be sent back on the [Data bus](Data%20bus.md).
