# Data Bus
The [Data bus](Computer-Science/Architecture/Data%20bus.md) is used to transport data between the various components attached to the [Motherboard](Motherboard.md). It's most commonly used to transfer data from the [CPU](Computer-Science/Architecture/CPU/CPU.md) to [Memory](Memory.md), or an [IO Device](IO%20Device.md).
