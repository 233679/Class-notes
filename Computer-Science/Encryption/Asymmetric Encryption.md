# Asymmetric Encryption
[[Computer-Science/Encryption/Asymmetric Encryption|Asymmetric Encryption]] uses a different keys to encrypt and decrypt the data.

It is common practice to share the key used to encrypt the data publicly ([[Computer-Science/Encryption/Public Key|Public Key]]), whist keeping the decryption key private ([[Computer-Science/Encryption/Private Key|Private Key]].
This allows anyone to create [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Cipher Text|Cipher Text]] from [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Plain Text|Plain Text]]. However, only you can decrypt the [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Cipher Text|Cipher Text]] into [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Plain Text|Plain Text]].

The [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Keys|Keys]] used in [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Asymmetric Encryption|Asymmetric Encryption]] tend to be in the range of 2000 to 5000 bits.
