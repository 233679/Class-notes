# Encryption
[[Computer-Science/Encryption/Encryption|Encryption]] is used to send confidential data across an untrustworthy system (the internet).
### Encrypting
[[#Encrypting]] is the act of converting [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Plain Text|Plain Text]] into [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Cipher Text|Cipher Text]].
### Decrypting
is the act of converting [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Cipher Text|Cipher Text]] back into the original [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Plain Text|Plain Text]].

There is two common ways of converting data, [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Symmetric Encryption|Symmetric Encryption]] and [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Asymmetric Encryption|Asymmetric Encryption]], with both being useful in different situations.
In general, [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Symmetric Encryption|Symmetric Encryption]] is faster than [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Asymmetric Encryption|Asymmetric Encryption]], but [[Computer-Science/Encryption/Symmetric Encryption|Symmetric Encryption]] is less secure.
