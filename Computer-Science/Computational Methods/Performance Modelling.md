# Performance Modelling
[[#Performance Modelling]] is the process of predicting and evaluating how well a computer system, algorithms, or program performs using mathematical models and simulations. This can help evaluate factors such as execution time, and memory space.

## Benefits
- Ensures performance requirements are met.
- Helps for capacity planning and scaling.
- Can identify lag/delays for end users.
- Can save time and cost before full implementation.

## Common Metrics
Common metrics that [[#Performance Modelling]] is used to analyse
- Execution time
- Throughout (tasks per unit time)
- Latency
- Resource Utilisation
- Scalability

## Techniques
#### Analytical Monitoring
Involves using mathematical equations such as [[Computer-Science/Algorithm-Complexity/Big-O|Big-O]] notation to analyse complexity
#### Simulation Modelling
Involves simulation worse case/what-if conditions that could be hard to replicate using test data. This is to ensure that applications do not break under unusual conditions.
#### Empirical Modelling
Involves simulation and performance testing based on data collected from end-users. This data can be used to optimise the application for the true use case, rather than the predicted use case.
