# Computer Misuse
The computer misuse act governs the laws around using computers. There are two sub-sections of computer misuse that are covered. Cyber-enabled crime (this is where using a computer isn't essential but helps the process of committing a crime), & Cyber-dependent crime (where a computer is an essential part of the crimal act, and the act couldn't be committed without one).

There are five main sections of this law:
---
### Unauthorized Access to Computer Material
This encapsulates any act of using a computer without the owners express permission.

### Unauthorized Access with Intent to Commit or Facilitate Commission of Further Offences
This involves using unauthorized access of a computer to then commit further crimes.

### Unauthorized Acts with Intent to Impair, or with Recklessness as to Impairing, Operation of a Computer.
This involves degrading someone else's experience of using a computer without the computer owners express consent.

### Unauthorized Acts Causing, or Creating risk Of, Serious Damage
