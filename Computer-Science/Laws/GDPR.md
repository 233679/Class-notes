# GDPR
The general data protection regulation (GDPR) is a law passed by the EU focusing on the rights of people to have privacy. It's the strongest law of it's kind that has ever been passed & enforced.
The law governs how companies can store data on residents of the EU & what rights the European citizens have in regards to their data.

The law supersedes the Data Protection Act, expanding on it in all aspects.
Some of the key areas that have seen significant change is:
- The definition of personal data has been expanded
- Every company that deals with any personal information is subject to this law & **MUST** obey it.
- People must now explicitly **OPT IN** to have their data collected, opposed to have to opting out.
- The enforcement in regards to data breaches has been tightened.
- People have a right to request a deletion off all their data & this request **MUST** be complied with.
