# RIPA
The Regulation of Investigatory Power Act governs the legal procedures that need to be followed before surveilling a resident of the UK. Using RIPA allows surveillance actives, that would otherwise be illegal, to be performed on "suspect" persons.

There are three commissioners that govern the administration of RIPA, Interception of Communications Commissioner, Intelligence Services Commissioner, and Chief Surveillance Commissioners. However, the oversight needed to enact RIPA is minimal, resulting in frequent misuses of RIPA.
