# Two's Complement
Is a way of storing signed binary values.
In [[#Two's Complement]] the most significant bit of a binary number has the equivalent value to that of an unsigned binary number, but the sign of the number is negative.

The value of a [[#Two's Complement]] encoded binary number can still be found via the sum of the positive bits.
### Examples

##### Five Bits

| -16 | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x   | x   | x   | x   | x   |
##### Eight Bits

| -128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x    | x   | x   | x   | x   | x   | x   | x   |

In the exam a binary value should be assumed not [[#Two's Complement]] unless specified otherwise.
