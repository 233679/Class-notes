# Polynomial Complexity
[Constant](Constant-Complexity.md), [linear](Linear-Complexity.md), & [quadratic](Quadratic-Complexity.md) algorithms are examples of polynomial algorithms.
The one uniting factor between these algorithms is that they all have a [Big O](../Big-O.md) of O($n^k$) where $k$ is a constant value. It can be any value, even 0, as show by [constant complexities](Constant-Complexity.md).
In general these algorithms scale terribly, with O($n^0$) ([constant complexities](Constant-Complexity.md)) being the one exception.
