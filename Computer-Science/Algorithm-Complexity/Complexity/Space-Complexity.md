# Space Complexity
Unlike other types of [complexity](Complexity-Index.md) space complexity doesn't concern the time an algorithm takes to compute. It represents the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running.
Most algorithms have a space complexity of [O(1)](Constant-Complexity.md). For example [linear search](../Searching%20algorithms/Linear-Search.md) uses the same amount of memory, regardless of the amount of inputs given. It will always only store the current index in the array that is being checked & the value to search for.
However, algorithms that "divide *&* conquer" tent to high a higher space complexity

#### Constant Complexity Algorithms
- [Bubble-Sort](../Sorting%20algorithms/Bubble-Sort.md)
- [Insertion-Sort](../Sorting%20algorithms/Insertion-Sort.md)
- [Linear-Search](../Searching%20algorithms/Linear-Search.md)
