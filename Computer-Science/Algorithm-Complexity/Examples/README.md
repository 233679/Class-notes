# README
These directory contain examples of the insertion sort & the bubble sort respectively.

The Insertion.java & Bubble.java contain the source code. The Insertion.class & Bubble.class contain the compiled java byte-code.
To run these programs (assuming you've cloned the repo). You should have java 21 installed (older version would probably work but not tested) & run "java Bubble" or "java Insertion".
