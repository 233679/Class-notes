# Sorting-Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are algorithms that take an unsorted array & convert it to a "sorted" array.
There is no hard definition for what constitutes an array as sorted. It is entirely context dependent. However, a sorted array is usually regarded as a set of numbers in ascending order or a collection of words in alphabetical order.

Examples of sorting algorithms:
- [Bubble sort](Bubble-Sort.md)
- [Merge sort](Merge-Sort.md)
- [Insertion sort](Insertion-Sort.md)
