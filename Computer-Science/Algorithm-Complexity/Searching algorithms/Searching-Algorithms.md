# Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms are a set of algorithms that are used to find an element within an array.

Two examples of searching algorithms are [linear search](Linear-Search.md) & [binary search](Binary-Search.md).

See [here](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) for a demonstration of them at work. Make sure input a number in the top left & select linear or binary search.
