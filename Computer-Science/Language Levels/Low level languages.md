# Low Level Languages
### Advantages
- They have similar if not the same efficiency as machine code
- Code can be extremely optimized.
- Provides direct access to system features, without being require to go though a software interface.
- The code you write is what gets run, it doesn't need to be modified by a compiler.

### Disadvantages
- Fully machine dependent, being very hard if not almost impossible to port
- It's very hard to write efficient & optimized machine code.
- Hand written code is prone to bugs & takes a long time.
- The code can be very hard to parse for humans, making it harder to modify & maintain.
