# Circuit Switching
Circuit switching involves creating a communication connection between two endpoints for the duration of a phone call or transfer of data.
This was useful for phone lines when they were first invented, as only one person can call another at a time.
However, this does not work for the modern internet. With billions of connections simultaneously.
