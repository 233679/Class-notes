# Router
A router is responsible for passing a packet to a different network to ensure that it reaches its intended destination, connecting networks together.

A common example of this is the router given out to clients that they use in their homes to connect their local network to the internet. These generally include, a [[Computer-Science/Networking/Switches|Switche]] and [[Computer-Science/Networking/DHCP|DHCP Sever]] as well.

Routers operate on the [[Computer-Science/Networking/TCP IP#Network Layer|Network Layer]] of the TCP/IP stack, as they route traffic over global networks.
