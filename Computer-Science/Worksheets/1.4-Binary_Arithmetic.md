2: $256^3 = 16,777,216$ X You need to subtract one, as 0 is a valid number => 16,777,215

3:
3 in s&m = 0000 0011
-9 in s&m = 1000 1001

Not commonly used, because it requires special handling to add and subtract numbers, whereas two's compliment can be added and subtracted using the same logic circuits as unsigned numbers.

4: 124 - 101
