# Flip Flops
"A flip flop is an elemental sequential logical circuit that can store one bit and flip between two states, 0 and 1."

Simplified diagram of a flip flop:

The "D" input is the data input, which the flip flop will store the value of when it is triggered by the [[Computer-Science/Boolean Algebra/Clock Signal|Clock Signal]]. Depending whether the flip flop is a rising edge or falling edge, it will be triggered by the clock pulse going from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 respectively.

### Use Cases
The main use case for flip flops is storing data in computers, either as registers or in [[SRAM]]
