# Interpreter
An [[Computer-Science/Programs/Interpreter|Interpreter]] is similar in function to a [[Computer-Science/Programs/Compiler|Compiler]]. The main difference is an [[Computer-Science/Programs/Interpreter|Interpreter]] compiles then runs the code line by line. Rather than [[../Programs/Compile|Compiling]] the [[../Programs/Program|Program]], then running it. This is also know as [[Computer-Science/Programs/JIT|JIT]].
