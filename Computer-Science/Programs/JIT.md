# JIT
A [[Computer-Science/Programs/JIT|JIT (Just In Time)]] [[Computer-Science/Programs/Compiler]] is a [[../Programs/Program|Program]] that executes [[../Programs/Byte Code|Byte Code]] rather than [[../Programs/Machine Code|Machine Code]]. This means that the code doesn't have to be [[../Programs/Compile|Compiled]] each time before it's run. But this comes at a performance penalty.
