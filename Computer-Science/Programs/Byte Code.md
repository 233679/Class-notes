# Byte Code
[Byte Code](Byte%20Code.md) is an intermediate step between [[Source Code]] & [[Machine Code]]. It's easier to read than [[Machine Code]], but harder to read than [[Source Code]]. The same applies to performance.
[[Byte Code]] does need to be [[../Translation/Compiler|Compiled]] before it's run, but after that it needs a [[../Virtual Machine]] to execute it.
