IDE vs Text editor

## Planning:

### Knowledge
IDE has language server support
langue server offers:
- Errors in IDE
- Function suggestions
- shortcuts for complex actions
- Code formatting
IDE Integrates with version control systems
IDE can do syntax highlighting
### Application
Showing errors in the IDE allows them to be identified earlier and solved easier.
Functions suggestions allow users to search for functions that suit their use case.
Shortcuts for complex actions can make repetitive tasks easier and quicker.
Code formatting ensure that all of a code base has an identical layout.
Version control system integration allows for easier collaboration and project management.
Syntax highlighting allows variables, methods, and keywords to be distinguished easily.
### Evaluation
Showing errors alongside the code improves the developer experience of finding and solving errors by having the outcome and the cause next to each other.
Function suggestions make it easier to find desired functions as the developer does not need to search for methods online or try to remember custom functions.
Shortcuts for common complex task eliminate the chance of errors occurring, reducing the amount of debugging work needed.
