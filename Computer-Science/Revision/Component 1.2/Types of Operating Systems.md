# Types of Operating Systems

### Distributed
Can coordinate the running of a single job across multiple computers.
Programs have access to data and resources from all the computers.

Since the multi-processing is handled by the OS, programs to not need to be written specifically for distributed operating systems.

### Multi-tasking
A single CPU core can appear to do more than one task simultaneously via [[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.2/Processor Scheduling|Processor Scheduling]].

An extreme example of this is Mainframe computers, which can be found in universities or large businesses. Mainframe's are accessed by multiple users performing multiple tasks simultaneously, via a terminal.

##### Mobile
A common example is mobile phones, which are computers with [[#Multi-tasking]] operating systems.

In general, they are more closely linked to the hardware running the operating system than other types of OS, as mobile phones are not modifiable.

### Embedded
Many embedded devices have simple OS for users to interact with, such as washing machines or microwaves. These OS's do not have many features and run on limited hardware; Performing simple tasks.
