# Programming Questions
In general when being asked programming questions they are going to be very simple, not complicated.
Try to find the most simple solution to the question that I am being asked.
(Most likely that) No classes that i'm asked to create will contain other classes (only primitives).
If i think that i did something wrong leave comments explaining my reasoning (more likely to give benefit of doubt).
