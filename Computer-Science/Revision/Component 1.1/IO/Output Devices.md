# Output Devices
Take data output from a computer and convert it into a format understandable by humans.

## Printers
#### Inkjet
Most common form of printer
#### Laser
use dry powered ink called toner.
fast & more reliable than inkjet
#### Dot Matrix
Work in a method similar to a typewriter
Poor print quality & expensive
Can work in damp and dirty conditions

### 3D printers
Can print 3D objects using plastic filament or other similar materials

##### Applications
Prototyping
One off components

## RFID
Can be used to both transmit and receive signals, such as with contactless payments

Uses:
- Item identification
- Logistics (item tracking)

### Passive
Passive tags have no power source and rely on power from the receiver for energy (wirelessly)

### Active
Active tags use a larger antenna and power to transmit a signal up to hundreds of meters

## Actuators (Motors)

## Speakers
Such as headphones or load speakers

## CCFL Monitors
(Cold Cathode Florescent Lamps)
These require a back-light as the light is blocked to produce the desired colour.

## LCD Monitors
(Liquid Crystal Display)
These do no require a back-light as LED's in the monitor produce their own light
There monitors are better than CCFL monitors for a variarity of reasons

## OLED
(Organic LED)
Much thinner, brighter, and lighter than LCD or LED screens

Backlight not needed as generate there own light
Less energy usage (good for mobile devices)
Little heat produced
Wider viewing angle

## Projector
### Multimedia
Compact, high resolution, full colour
