# Instruction Set

## CISC
(Complex instruction set computers)
- Have lots of instructions
- Instructions vary in execution time

Benefits:
- Quicker to code in assembly
- Compilers can be simpler as less work is needed translating programs to machine code
- Less RAM needed, as each instruction does more
## RISC
(Reduced instruction set computers)
- Fewer instructions
- Each instruction takes a single clock pulse

Benefits:
- Hardware is simpler & cheaper to build
- Pipelining is easier (each instruction takes one cycle)
- RISC allows for better performance.
