# CPU

## Control Unit
Coordinates the activity of all other components via signals sent and received from the **control [[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.1/Buses/Bus|Bus]]**.
Example control signals:
- Memory write
- Memory read
- Bus request (request access to [[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.1/Buses/Data Bus|Data Bus]])
- Bus grant (CPU gives access to [[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.1/Buses/Data Bus|Data Bus]])
- Clock

## ALU
Arithmetic-Logic Unit
Performs arithmetic, logical, and shift operations on data.
- (+, -, $\times$, $\div$)
- (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- (bit shifts)
In general the ALU has a [[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.1/Register|Register]] dedicated to it.
