# Storage

Two main types of memory, RAM & ROM

## RAM
Random Access Memory
Stores data and instructions for running programs
Volatile Memory
Can be read and written to
## ROM
Read Only Memory
Stores the full code for a program and necessary data. Commonly used to store a BIOS
Non Volatile
Can be read from

If RAM is full then secondary storage will be used as **virtual memory** to store the least used data from RAM to make room for the data.

## Primary Storage
RAM is an example of primary storage.
Primary storage is volatile, quick to query.

## Secondary Storage
Hard drives are an example of secondary storage
They are non-volatile, but slower to query

### Hard Drives
High storage capacity per £, slow to read and write
sequential data is read faster (still slowly) then non-sequential data

### Solid State Drives
Lower storage per £, fast to read & write
Same speed for sequential & non-sequential data

### Solid State Media
No moving parts
Less power consumption
Smaller

### Optical
Cheap to mass - produce
can come as read only, write once, or write multiple
Light
Easy to damage and lose data
