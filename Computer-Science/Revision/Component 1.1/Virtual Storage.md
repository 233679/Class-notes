# Virtual Storage
[[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.1/Virtual Storage|Virtual Storage]] (also known as **cloud storage**) is methodology of data storage where data is stored across multiple locations, most commonly cloud providers, instead of locally on a machine. This is often transparent to the user, with the data appearing as local data.

[[Computer-Science/Revision/Component 1.1/Virtual Storage|Virtual Storage]] is useful for eliminating the bottleneck of capacity of local machines, and reduces risk of data loss, as all data is stored in multiple locations with redundant copies.

| Advantages                         | Disadvantages                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Data can be accessed on any device | Data cannot be access without an internet connection |
| Protects data via multiple copies  | Can be infeasible with sensitive data.               |
| Easy to increase storage space     | The ongoing cost can be high                         |
