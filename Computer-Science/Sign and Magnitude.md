# Sign and Magnitude
Is a way of representing negative numbers in binary.

if the most significant bit in a sequence is high, then the value of the number is negative. Finding the value is the same as normal binary values, with the most significant being excluded, as it is the sign.
### Examples

| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |      |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| -/+ | 4   | 2   | 1   | = -3 |

| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |      |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| -/+ | 4   | 2   | 1   | = +5 |
