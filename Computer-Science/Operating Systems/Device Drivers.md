# Device Drivers
[Device Drivers](Device%20Drivers.md) are more "low level" than [Operating Systems](Operating%20System.md). They generally provide a standardised way to interact with external devices being used by the [Operating System](Operating%20System.md). An example of a device with a driver is a printer. If you get a new printer you don't need to change the [Operating System](Operating%20System.md), a new [Device Drivers](Device%20Drivers.md) is all that's needed.
