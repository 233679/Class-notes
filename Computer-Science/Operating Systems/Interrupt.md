# Interrupt
An [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Interrupt|Interrupt]] is a hardware or software event that **interrupts** the current [[Computer-Science/Programs/Program|Program]] being executed by the [[Computer-Science/Architecture/CPU/CPU|CPU]], changing what the [[Computer-Science/Architecture/CPU/CPU|CPU]] is executing.

When a [[Computer-Science/Programs/Program|Program]] is interrupted, the data used by that program is put on the stack, so when the [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Interrupt|Interrupt]] has finished, the previous [[Computer-Science/Programs/Program|Program]] can resume execution.

Note: An [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Interrupt|Interrupt]] can be [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Interrupt|Interrupted]]!
### Examples
- CPU clock
- Printer running out of paper
