# Real Time Operating System
[Real Time Operating System](Real%20Time%20Operating%20System.md) are like normal [Operating Systems](Operating%20System.md),
except they are designed to handle time sensitive tasks, executing them instantly without any delay from [[Computer-Science/Processor Scheduling/Processor Scheduling|Processor Scheduling]]. Furthermore, they are created with extra focus on not encountering an unrecoverable error. This is enabled by good programming & having backup components ready to be used at a moments notice.

These qualities are important in situations such as manufacturing, where machines need to control tools are exact times, otherwise the product could get destroyed.
