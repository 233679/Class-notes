# Operating System
In general, an [Operating System](Operating%20System.md) is a [Program](../Programs/Program.md) that acts as an interpretation layer between other[Programs](../Programs/Program.md) and the hardware of a computer. This allows for the same code to be run on almost all configurations of [Hardware](../Hardware.md) (A good example of this is desktop pc's!). However, this does not always allow for cross-[Architecture](../Architecture/Architecture.md) execution of [Programs](../Programs/Program.md).

The main purpose of an [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Operating System|Operating System]] is to [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Memory Management|Manage Memory]], user interface, [[Computer-Science/Operating Systems/Interrupt|Interrupts]], and [[Computer-Science/Processor Scheduling/Processor Scheduling|Processor Scheduling]].

The exam board has defined certain types of [Operating Systems](Operating%20System.md) that are "special". These are:
- [Distributed Operating Systems](Distributed%20Operating%20System.md) (This one **is** special).
- [Mobile Operating System](Mobile%20Operating%20System.md).
- [Basic Input Output System](Basic%20Input%20Output%20System.md).
- [Embedded Operating Systems](Embedded%20Operating%20Systems.md).
- [Open-source Operating Systems](Open-source%20Operating%20Systems.md).
- [Real Time Operating System](Real%20Time%20Operating%20System.md).
- [[Multi User Operating System]].
- [[Multi Task Operating System]].
