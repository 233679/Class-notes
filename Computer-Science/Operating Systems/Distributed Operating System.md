# Distributed Operating System
[Distributed Operating Systems](Distributed%20Operating%20System.md) split the different components of a computer, (e.g. [RAM](../Architecture/RAM.md), [CPU](../Architecture/CPU.md), etc) across multiple separate computers, with each one (or multiple) acting as a core component. Using a [Distributed Operating System](Distributed%20Operating%20System.md) appears almost identical to a non-distributed [Operating System](Operating%20System.md) from the users perspective. This is because all the resource allocation is handed behind the scenes by the [Distributed Operating System](Distributed%20Operating%20System.md).

[Distributed Operating Systems](Distributed%20Operating%20System.md) can make heavy use of [Processor Scheduling](../Processor%20Scheduling/Processor%20Scheduling.md), since they are being used by multiple users & are very powerful compared to personal computers (This reduces the impact of [Processor Scheduling](../Processor%20Scheduling/Processor%20Scheduling.md)).
