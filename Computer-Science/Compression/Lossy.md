# Lossy
[[Computer-Science/Compression/Lossy|Lossy Compression]] is [[Computer-Science/Compression/Compression|Compression]] where the uncompressed data does not have to *exactly* match the source.
The main use case for this is media content, such as music and images. The file size of the content can be dramatically reduced (alot more than when using [[Computer-Science/Compression/Lossless|Lossless Compression]]) by discarding data that the human senses cannot easily perceive.
