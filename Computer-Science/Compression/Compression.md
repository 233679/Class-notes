# Compression
Compression is where the size of data is reduced.
Their are two types of compression. [[Computer-Science/Compression/Lossless|Lossless]] compression, and [[Computer-Science/Compression/Lossy|Lossy]] compression.

[[Computer-Science/Compression/Lossy|Lossy Compression]] can compress data better than [[Computer-Science/Compression/Lossless|Lossless Compression]], as it discards some data during compression, which cannot be retrieved from the compressed file.
