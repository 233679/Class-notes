# Defenses
Increasing the quality of code can help guard against [[Computer-Science/Cyber Security/Malicious Software|Malware]] by making software more robust and less susceptible to attacks.

Things to guard against:
- Buffer overflow attack
- SQL injection
- Two factor authentication
- Require strong passwords
- Least privilege (eg file access rights)

#### Buffer Overflow
This occurs when a program writes data into memory that is larger than the allocated space. This can be used to overwrite instructions in memory to change what the program will execute.

## Mitigations
### Monitoring
Monitoring of data and network traffic can help identify a [[Computer-Science/Cyber Security/Malicious Software|Malware]] before it can cause damage.

### Prevention
Prevention includes keeping software up to date to remove discovered vulnerabilities. And anti-virus programs to identify and remove [[Computer-Science/Cyber Security/Malicious Software|Malicious Software]] before it can be run.
