# Firewall
A firewall is either a software or hardware that controls access to and from a network. This necessitates it to be placed between the link from the LAN to the WAN (usually between the [[Computer-Science/Networking/Router|Router]] and ISP infrastructure).

A firewall can block both incoming and outgoing connections based upon the source address, destination address, source port, destination port, packet type, and many more factors.
To achieve this, firewalls operate on multiple layers of the [[Computer-Science/Networking/TCP IP|TCP IP stack]].
