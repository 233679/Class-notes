A)
![[Q1A.png]]

The plate looses it's charge, because the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the light, which is behaving as photons, interacts with the delocalized electrons on the surface on the metal plate. The delocalized electrons are at the surface of the metal plate, as each electron is negatively charged, and as they are delocalized they repel each other, causing them to evenly distribute over the surface of the metal plate.
The interaction between the photons and the electrons is a destructive one, where the photon converts all of its mass to energy & displaces the delocalized electron from the metal, having converted all of the energy from the photon into kinetic energy. The displaced electron is known as a photoelectron.
The reason that this effect only occurs above the threshold frequency, is that each photon needs a minimum amount of energy to displace the electron from the metal. However, a frequency over the threshold frequency does not increase the rate of loss of charge, as each photon only interacts with a single electron.
Intensity, however, does increase the rate of loss of charge. This is because the intensity represents the amount of photons that are incident to the metal. More photons leads to a faster loss of charge.

$E_{photon} = hf = 6.63\times10^{-34}\times1.2\times10^{15} = 8.0\times10^{-19}$
$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi$
$\phi = E_{photon} - E_{Kmax} = 8.0\times10^{-19} - $

A current is measured on the microammeter only when electromagnetic radiation with a frequency greater than a certain value is incident on the photoemissive surface.

### A
Explain why the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation must be greater than a certain value.

# 3
The photoelectric effect can be demonstrated by illuminating a negatively charged plate, made from certain metals, with ultraviolet (UV) light and showing that the plate loses its charge.

### A
Explain why, when ultraviolet light is shone on a **positively** charged plate, no charge is lost by the plate.

Unsure.
Note: I thought that a surface only needed delocalised electronics, regardless of the charge.

### B
Threshold frequency and work function are important ideas in the study of the photoelectric effect.
Tables 1 and 2 summarise the work functions of three metals and photon energies of three UV light sources.
![[Q2B.png]]
Discuss the combinations of metal and UV light source that could best be used to demonstrate the idea of threshold frequency and the idea of work function.

The combination of Zinc & light source 3, would be a good demonstration of the photoelectric effect. As the energy of the photons is dramality higher than the work function of Zinc, meaning that the light is above the threshold frequency for Zinc. This would easily allow for the photoelectric effect to occur. Furthermore, since the work function is a measurement of the minimum energy required to release an electron, the light from source 3 would cause a higher rate of loss of charge of the zinc, because the light can release delocalised electrons from further bellow the surface. However, one photon can only release one electron at a time, regardless of the energy of the photon.

### C
Calculate the maximum kinetic energy, in J, of the electrons emitted from a zinc plate when illuminated with ultraviolet light.
work function of zinc = 4.3 eV
frequency of ultraviolet light = $1.2\times10^{15}$Hz

$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi = 6.63\times10^{-34}\times1.2\times10^{15} - 4.3\times1.60\times10^{-19} = 6.9\times10^{-20}$J

### D
Explain why your answer is a maximum.

My answer is the maximum kinetic energy that a released photoelectron could have, as the work function is the minimum amount of energy needed to release a photoelectron. So using the work function was assuming that the energy required to displace the delocalised electron was the least possible, converting the most energy possible into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron.
