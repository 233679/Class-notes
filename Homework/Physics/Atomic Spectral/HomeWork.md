### B
A W plus particle is responsible for this decay, as the total atomic mass remains the same, yet there is one less proton. This occurs when a neutrino interacts with a proton, resulting in a neutron & a beta plus particle.
### C
The line near A for helium & hydrogen is very similar, so it could be plausible that the absorption caused be the helium could be attributed to hydrogen. The same applies for lines B, C, & F.
The line E for sodium & helium are also very similar.
However, the line at D has no similar line in sodium or helium. Furthermore, the line before E in sodium is not at all present in helium.
### D
$E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63\times10^{-34}\times3.00\times10^8}{590\times10^{-9}} = 3.4\times10^{-19}$J
$3.4\times10^{-19}$J $= 5.4$eV
### E
An emission spectrum is the wavelengths of light than an atom can emit when de-exciting. The wavelength of light emitted is determined by the energy released when the electron moves to a lower energy level.
Whereas, an absorption spectrum is the specific wavelengths of light that can excite an electron to a higher energy level around an atom.
