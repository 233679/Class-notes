### B
A W plus particle is responsible for this decay, as the total atomic mass remains the same, yet there is one less proton. This occurs when a neutrino interacts with a proton, resulting in a neutron & a beta plus particle.
### C
The line near A for helium & hydrogen is very similar, so it could be plausible that the absorption caused be the helium could be attributed to hydrogen.
