# De Bounce
[[De Bounce]] is a circuit that can smooth out the signal from a switch, since a switch will bounce before making a complete contact. Which is bad since it'd switch the voltage from high to low rapidly. This can cause unintended behaviour within [[Electronics/Circuits/Circuit|Circuits]]
