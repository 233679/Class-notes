# Propagation Delay
[[Propagation Delay]] is the amount of time it takes for a "thing" (often a change in log state) to arrive at a point in a [[Circuits/Circuit|Circuit]]. The [[Propagation Delay]] can be influenced by the amount of wire of [[Integrated Circuit|]] [[Integrated Circuit|Integrated Circuits]] within a [[Circuits/Circuit|Circuit]]. It's important to keep [[Propagation Delay]] in mind when creating circuits, as if the logic signals arrive at differing times "things don't work" (to use the technical term).
