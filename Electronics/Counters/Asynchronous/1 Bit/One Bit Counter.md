# One Bit Counter
A [[Electronics/Counters/Asynchronous/1 Bit/One Bit Counter]] can count up to one. This type of counter can be made using a [[Electronics/Timing/Flip Flop/Flip Flop|Flip Flop]]

With A being the output.

An interesting property of this is that the output of A is half the frequency of of the input clock.
