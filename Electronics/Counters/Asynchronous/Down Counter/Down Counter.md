# Down Counter

A [[Electronics/Counters/Asynchronous/Down Counter/Down Counter]] is made up of [[Electronics/Timing/Latches/SR Bistable|SR Bistable]] [[Electronics/Integrated Circuit|Integrated Circuits]]. Unlike in [[Electronics/Counters/Asynchronous/3 Bit/Three Bit Counter|Three Bit Counters]], the clock for the next [[Electronics/Timing/Latches/SR Bistable|SR Bistable]] is connected to $Q$, not $\overline{Q}$. Also they count down, not up!
