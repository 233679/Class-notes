# Voltage
[Voltage](Electronics/Voltage/Voltage.md) (also known as potential difference) is a measure of the difference in electrical potential between two points. [Voltage](Electronics/Voltage/Voltage.md) is commonly measured between wires & components within a [Circuit](../Circuits/Circuit.md).

[Voltage](Electronics/Voltage/Voltage.md) is commonly measured with a voltmeter.

The relationship between [Voltage](Electronics/Voltage/Voltage.md), [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md), & [Resistance](../Ohms%20law/Resistance.md) is defined by [Ohms Law](../Ohms%20law/Ohms%20Law.md).
