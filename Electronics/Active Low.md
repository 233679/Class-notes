# Active Low
[[Active Low]] inputs are inputs that perform the desired "thing" when the input is low (Logic 0).
These inputs are denoted by a bar over a letter, similar to a not in [[Boolean Algebra/Boolean Algebra|Boolean Algebra]].

However, [[Active Low]] can often be hard to think about. This makes it harder to use.
