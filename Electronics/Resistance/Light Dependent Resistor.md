# Light Dependent Resistor
A [[Light Dependent Resistor]] (LDR) is a type of [[Variable Resistor]], whose voltage depends on the amount of light that is incident to the [[Light Dependent Resistor]].

The [[Resistance]] **decreases** as the incident light **increases**.
The [[Resistance]] **increases** as the incident light **decreases**.
