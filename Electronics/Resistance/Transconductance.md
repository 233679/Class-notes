# Transconductance
Is the ability of a material to conduct [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md).

It's calculated with the formula:
$S = \Delta I / \Delta V$
- $S$ - Siemens
- $\Delta I$ - Change in [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md)
- $\Delta V$ - Change in [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md)

An interesting note is that this formula is the flipped one of $R = V/I$

- Measured in Siemens
