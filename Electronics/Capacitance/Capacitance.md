# Capacitance
[Capacitance](Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitance.md) is the ability of a component to store charge, this is measured in [Farads](Farads.md).

## Calculate Capacitance
Calculating [Capacitance](Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitance.md) uses the formula:
$Q = C * V$

- $Q$ - The amount of charge of a [Capacitor](Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitor.md).
- $C$ - The [Capacitance](Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitance.md).
- $V$ - The [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md) across a [Capacitor](Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitor.md).
