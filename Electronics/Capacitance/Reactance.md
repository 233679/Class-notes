# Reactance
[[Electronics/Capacitance/Reactance|Reactance]] is the [[Electronics/Resistance/Resistance|Resistance]] produced by a [[Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitor|Capacitor]] when [[Electronics/AC|AC]] current is run though it. This is because a [[Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitor|Capacitor]] block [[Electronics/DC|DC]] current, but acts as [[Electronics/Resistance/Resistor|Resistor]] when [[Electronics/AC|AC]] current is run though it.

The symbol for [[Electronics/Capacitance/Reactance|Reactance]] is "$X_c$" & it is measured in Ohms "$\Omega$".
The formula for [[Electronics/Capacitance/Reactance|Reactance]] is:
$X_c = \frac{1}{2\pi fC}$
Where:
$X_c$ = [[Electronics/Capacitance/Reactance|Reactance]]
$f$ = The frequency of the current.
$C$ = [[Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitance|Capacitance]] of the [[Electronics/Capacitance/Capacitor|Capacitor]]
