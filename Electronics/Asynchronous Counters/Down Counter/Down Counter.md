# Down Counter

A [[Down Counter]] is made up of [[../../Timing/Latches/SR Bistable|SR Bistable]] [[../../Integrated Circuit|Integrated Circuits]]. Unlike in [[../3 Bit/Three Bit Counter|Three Bit Counters]], the clock for the next [[../../Timing/Latches/SR Bistable|SR Bistable]] is connected to $Q$, not $\overline{Q}$. Also they count down, not up!
