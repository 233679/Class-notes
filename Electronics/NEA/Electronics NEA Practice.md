# Electronics NEA Practice

# Problem
The problem that my circuit will solve is the process of determining the output of AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR two input logic gates.
This is a problem that needs solving as it is easy to mix up the truth tables of all of these logic gates.



Note: Switch bounce is an issue
