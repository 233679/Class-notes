# Circuit
A circuit is an unbroken[^1] loop of a conductor that [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) flows through.

There are two main types of [Circuit](../../..//Electronics/Circuits/Circuit.md). A [Series Circuit](Series%20Circuit.md) & a [Parallel Circuit](Parallel%20Circuit.md). These types of [Circuits](../../..//Electronics/Circuits/Circuit.md) can be connected in any combination, with [Parallel Circuits](Parallel%20Circuit.md) connected in series & vice versa.

[^1]: A [Circuit](../../..//Electronics/Circuits/Circuit.md) is can have a "break" / "gap" in it & still have [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) flow through it. As long as the electromagnetic field of the [Circuit](../../..//Electronics/Circuits/Circuit.md) spans the "break" then [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) will still flow.
