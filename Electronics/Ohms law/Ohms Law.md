# Ohms Law
Ohms Law states the relationship between [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md), [Current](Current.md), & [Resistance](Resistance.md) with the formula: $V = I*R$ .

$V$ - [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md)
$I$ - [Current](Current.md)
$R$ - [Resistance](Resistance.md)

The formula can be rearranged to calculate [Current](Current.md) or [Resistance](Resistance.md) like so:
- $I = V/_R$
- $R = V/_I$
