# Voltage
[Voltage](../../..//Electronics/Ohms%20law/Voltage.md) (also known as potential difference) is a measure of the difference in electrical potential between two points. [Voltage](../../..//Electronics/Ohms%20law/Voltage.md) is commonly measured between wires & components within a [Circuit](../Circuits/Circuit.md).

[Voltage](../../..//Electronics/Ohms%20law/Voltage.md) is commonly measured with a voltmeter.

The relationship between [Voltage](../../..//Electronics/Ohms%20law/Voltage.md), [Current](Current.md), & [Resistance](Resistance.md) is defined by [Ohms Law](Ohms%20Law.md).
