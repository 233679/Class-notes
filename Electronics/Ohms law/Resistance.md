# Resistance
Resistance is a measurement of the opposition to the flow of [Current](Electronics/Ohms%20law/Current.md).
The relationship between [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md), [Current](Electronics/Ohms%20law/Current.md), & [Resistance](../../..//Electronics/Ohms%20law/Resistance.md) is defined by [Ohms Law](Ohms%20Law.md).

## Parallel Calculation
In a [Parallel Circuit](../Circuits/Parallel%20Circuit.md) [Resistance](Resistance.md) is calculated by the formula:
$Rt = (Rn^{-1} + R2n^{-1})^{-1}$

## Series Calculation
In a [Series Circuit](../Circuits/Series%20Circuit.md) [Resistance](Resistance.md) is calculated by the formula:
$Rt = Rn + R2n$

### Values
- $Rt$ - total [Resistance](Resistance.md).
- $Rn$ - value of a [Resistance](Resistance.md)
