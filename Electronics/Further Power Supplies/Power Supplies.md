# Power Supplies

A power supply with negative feedback (one with an op amp) can act as a variable power supply by varying $Rf$. $V_{out}$ can vary between $V_z$ & $V_s$

Furthermore, $V_{out}$ = $V_z$ due to the Op Amp. It keeps $V_{out}$ at $V_z$ by closing the transistor, which increases $V_{out}$ if $V_{out}$ is bellow $V_z$ & opening the transistor, which decreases $V_{out}$ if $V_{out}$ is above $V_z$
