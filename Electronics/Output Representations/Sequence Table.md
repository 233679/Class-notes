# Sequence Table
A [[Sequence Table]] is a representation of the changes in the input & outputs of a [[Circuits/Circuit|Circuit]] over time. This is very useful for [[Circuits/Circuit|Circuits]], whose output depends upon the input. An example of this is the [[../Timing/Latches/SR Bistable|SR Bistable]].
