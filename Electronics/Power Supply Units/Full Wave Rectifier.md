In a full wave rectifier, the [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) follows through 2 [Diodes](../Diodes/Diodes.md) (the other two are used to block the [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md)), which means the [Peak Voltage](Peak%20Voltage.md) (peak voltage) drops by 1.4V ([Diodes](../Diodes/Diodes.md) have a 0.7V drop).

However, the output [DC](../DC.md) waveform isn't constant, it varies by huge amounts. To help smooth out the [DC](../DC.md) [Voltage](../Ohms%20law/Voltage.md) a smoothing [[capacitor]] can be added to the circuit.

The frequency of the [DC](../DC.md) waveform is double that of the [AC](../AC.md) value.
