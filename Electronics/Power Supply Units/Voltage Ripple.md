# Voltage Ripple

[Voltage Ripple](../../..//Electronics/Power%20Supply%20Units/Voltage%20Ripple.md) is the difference between the highest & lowest [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Peak Voltage|Peak Voltage]] of a [DC](../DC.md) [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md) produced by a [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Wave Rectifier|Wave Rectifier]] with a [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Smoothing Capacitor|Smoothing Capacitor]].

Voltage ripple is defined by the formula:
$V_{rip} = \frac{I_{load}}{F\times C}$

$V_{rip}$ - [Voltage Ripple](../../..//Electronics/Power%20Supply%20Units/Voltage%20Ripple.md).
$F$ - Ripple frequency (of the [AC](../AC.md) [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md)).
$I_{load}$ - [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) load (load across internal [Resistance](../Ohms%20law/Resistance.md)).
$C$ - [Capacitance](../Capacitance/Capacitance.md) (of the smoothing [Capacitor](../Capacitance/Capacitor.md)).

To reduce Vrip ([Voltage Ripple](Voltage%20Ripple.md)):
- Increase [Capacitance](../Capacitance/Capacitance.md).
- Increase frequency.
- Large load value - Reduce [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md).
