# Voltage Ripple

[Voltage Ripple](../../..//Electronics/Power%20Supply%20Units/Voltage%20Ripple.md) is the difference between the highest & lowest [pk](Peak%20Voltage.md) of a [DC](../DC.md) [Voltage](../Ohms%20law/Voltage.md).

Voltage ripple is defined by the formula:
$Vrip = Il/Fr *C$

`Vrip` - [Voltage Ripple](../../..//Electronics/Power%20Supply%20Units/Voltage%20Ripple.md).
`Fr` - Ripple frequency (of the [AC](../AC.md) [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md)).
`Il` - [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) load (load across internal [Resistance](../Ohms%20law/Resistance.md)).
`C` - [Capacitance](Capacitance) (of the smoothing [[capacitor]]).

To reduce Vrip:
- Increase [[Capacitance]].
- Increase frequency.
- Large load value - Reduce [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md).
