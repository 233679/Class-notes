# RMS
RMS is the standard unit used for measuring [AC](../AC.md). It represents the [DC](../DC.md) [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md) that an [AC](../AC.md) [Voltage](../Voltage/Voltage.md) can be converted to using a [Wave Rectifier](Wave%20Rectifier.md).

#### Formula:
- $pk = rms/_\sqrt{2}$
- $rms = pk/_\sqrt{2}$

$pk$ - [Peak Voltage](Peak%20Voltage.md)
$rms$ - [RMS](RMS.md)

An easy way to remember the formula is that RMS is **always** lower than the [Peak Voltage](Peak%20Voltage.md).
