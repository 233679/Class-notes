# Half Wave Rectifier
A [Half Wave Rectifier](Half%20Wave%20Rectifier.md) converts an [AC](../AC.md) input to a [DC](../DC.md) output (although not very well).

Example [Circuit](../Circuits/Circuit.md) of a [Half wave rectifier](Half%20wave%20rectifier.md):

When the direction of the [[Physics/Electricity/Current|Current]] & [[Electronics/Diodes/Diodes|Diode]] is aligned (this is known as forward bias), the [[Electronics/Diodes/Diodes|Diode]] allows the [[Electronics/AC|AC]] current to flow through. But, when the [[Electronics/AC|AC]] is flowing against the [[Electronics/Diodes/Diodes|Diode]], (reverse bias), it blocks the [[Physics/Electricity/Current|Current]] which means no voltage gets though the [[Electronics/Diodes/Diodes|Diode]].
The result of this is that only positive [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Voltage]] can traverse the [[Electronics/Diodes/Diodes|Diode]].

There is a drop in [Peak Voltage](Peak%20Voltage.md) between the input & the output, because the [Current](../Ohms%20law/Current.md) flows though a [Diodes](../Diodes/Diodes.md), experiencing a [Voltage Drop](../Voltage/Voltage%20Drop.md) of 0.7V.

Unlike a [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Full Wave Rectifier|Full Wave Rectifier]], the output frequency of the [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Half wave rectifier|Half wave rectifier]] is the same as the input frequency.
