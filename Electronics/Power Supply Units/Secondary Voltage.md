# Secondary Voltage
[[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Secondary Voltage|Secondary Voltage]] is the voltage after it has traversed a [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Wave Rectifier|Wave Rectifier]].

If it traversed a [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Full Wave Rectifier|Full Wave Rectifier]] then it is 1.4V less than the supply voltage.
If it traversed a [[Electronics/Power Supply Units/Half wave rectifier|Half wave rectifier]] then it is 0.7V less than the supply voltage.
