# Common Cathode
A [[Common Cathode]] is type of [[Seven Segment Display]].

In the [[Common Cathode]] all the [[../Diodes/Light Emitting Diodes|Light Emitting Diodes]] that make up the display are connected to the same Cathode. This causes the LEDs to emit light when a logic 1 is passed into them.
