### A
Photoelectric emission from a metal surface refers to the photoelectrons that were released from the surface of the metal when incident light is above the threshold frequency.

### B
Photoelectric emission only occurs above a "threshold frequency", because a minimum amount of energy, referred to as the work function, is needed to release a delocalised electron from the surface of the metal.
