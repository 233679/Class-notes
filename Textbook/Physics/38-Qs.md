- In excitation the electron transfers to an outer shell. Whereas in de-excitation, an electron transfers to an inner shell.
- In excitation a photon is absorbed to transfer the electron. Whereas in de-excitation, a photon is emitted to release energy, moving the electron to a "more inner" shell.

This is because, the atoms inside the tube are being excited and ionised by photons provided by the flow of current from the connected circuit. So when the circuit is disconnected, there is nothing sustaining the fluorescents & it quickly extinguishes.
