$h = 6.63\times10^{-34}$Js
$c = 3.00\times10^8$ms$^{-1}$
$e = 1.6\times10^{-19}$C

### A
This is because the frequency of the blue light was above the threshold frequency for the cathode, so the photoelectric effect could occur. The intensity of the light determines the rate of the photoelectric effect, not the frequency of the light.

### B
This is because the frequency of the red light is bellow the threshold frequency for the cathode, so the photoelectric effect could not occur. The intensity of the light determines the rate of the photoelectric effect, not the frequency of the light.

### A
photoelectrons per second $= \frac{A}{e}$
$\frac{2.5\times10^{-7}}{1.6\times10^{-19}} = 1.6\times10^{12}$ photoelectrons per second

### B
The reading of the microammeter is doubled if the intensity of the incident light is doubled, because the intensity of the light is a measurement of how many photons there is at a given time. Since a single photon, above the threshold frequency will release a single photoelectron, if the intensity is doubled, then the number of photoelectrons will also double.

### A
$E = hf = 6.63\times10^{-34}\times590\times10^{-9} = 3.9\times10^{40}$J

### B
Since the number of photoelectrons per second is proportional to the number of photons per second:
photons per second = $\frac{I}{e} = \frac{4\times10^{-7}}{1.6\times10^{-19}} = 3\times10^{12}$ photons per second

### C
photoelectrons per second = $\frac{I}{e} = \frac{4\times10^{-7}}{1.6\times10^{-19}} = 3\times10^{12}$ photoelectrons per second

### A
i - $4.0\times10^{12}$Hz
ii - $2.2\times10^{-19}$J

### B
$f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{3.00\times10^8}{435\times10^{-9}} =6.90\times10^{14}$Hz
$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi = (6.63\times10^{-34}\times6.90\times10^{14}) - 1.9\times10^{-19} = 2.7\times10^{-19}$J
