# 35-Qs
$e = 1.6\times10^{-19}$C

One similarity between ionisation & excitation is that both of them involve an electron colliding with an atom. One difference between ionisation & excitation is that in ionisation, the electron is released from the atom, whereas in excitation, the electron moves to an outer shell.

### A
$E = e\times1.6\times10^{-19} = 10.4\times1.6\times10^{-19} = 1.7\times10^{-18}$

### B
$12.0 - 10.4 = 1.6$eV

The ionisation energy of neon is much greater than that of sodium. Therefore, less energy is needed to remove an electron from a sodium atom than from a neon atom.

An electron that causes excitation of an atom by colliding with it has more kinetic energy before the collision than after the collision. The atom's internal energy increase and the electron's kinetic energy decreases.

### A
In this situation the gas atom has been excited. This entails the electron colliding with the atom with a specific kinetic energy that is unique to each atom. The colliding electron would give its kinetic energy into the atom's internal energy, causing an atomic electron to move to an outer shell.

### B
A gas atom cannot absorb energy from a slow-moving electron that collides with it, because the electron doesn't have enough kinetic energy to either excite, or ionise the atom. So the electron can't interact with the atom in either of these ways.
