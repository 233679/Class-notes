1.5 moles of an ideal gas at a temperature of 312K is kept at a pressure of $1.7\times10^5$Pa. Calculate the volume of the gas under these conditions.

$\frac{pV}{T} = nR$
$V = \frac{nRT}{p} = \frac{312\times1.5\times8.31}{1.7\times10^5} = 0.023m^3$

A weather balloon contains helium gas and occupies a volume of 0.85m$^3$. At a particular weather station, the pressure is $1.2\times10^5$Pa and the temperature of the surrounding air is 18$\degree$C. Assuming that helium behaves as an ideal gas, show that the balloon contains about 42 moles of helium gas.

$\frac{pV}{T} = nR$
$18 - 273 = -255K$
$n = \frac{pV}{TR} = \frac{1.2\times10^5\times0.85}{-255\times8.31} = -48$
