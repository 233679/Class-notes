# Specific Latent Heat
[[Physics/Thermal/Specific Latent Heat|Specific Latent Heat]] is the energy transferred per kg during the change of state (flat parts of a [[Unsorted/Phase Change Diagram|Phase Change Diagram]]), **without** a change in temperature.

[[Physics/Thermal/Specific Latent Heat|Specific Latent Heat]] can be measured with this formula:
$Q = mL$
$L = \frac{Q}{m}$

$L$ - [[Physics/Thermal/Specific Latent Heat|Specific Latent Heat]]
$Q$ - Energy transferred
$m$ - mass
