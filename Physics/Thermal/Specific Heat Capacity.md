# Specific Heat Capacity

[[Physics/Thermal/Specific Heat Capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]] is the energy transferred to/from a substance per kg, per $\degree$C change in temperature **WITHOUT** any change in state (The diagonal parts of a [[Unsorted/Phase Change Diagram|Phase Change Diagram]]).
The **specific** in [[Physics/Thermal/Specific Heat Capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]] means **per unit mass**. E.G kg.
The formula for [[Physics/Thermal/Specific Heat Capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]] is:
$Q = mc\Delta \theta$

$Q$ = [[Physics/Thermal/Energy Transferred]] (in [[Physics/Joules|Joule]])
$m$ = Mass
$c$ = [[Physics/Thermal/Specific Heat Capacity|Specific Heat Capacity]]
$\Delta\theta$ = Change in temperature
