# Absolute Zero
[[Physics/Thermal/Absolute Zero|Absolute Zero]] is the temperature of 0K. This is the coldest temperature that can exist. Any temperature lower is impossible.

This can be proven by enclosing a gas inside a sealed chamber and decreasing the temperature of the gas. As the temperature of the gas decreases it's volume will also decrease. Measuring the pressure at the ice point & steam point, it can be observed that the line on the temperature axis is **always** at -273$\degree$C. This remains the same regardless of the gas used.

The proof for [[Physics/Thermal/Absolute Zero|Absolute Zero]] is further reinforced by [[Unsorted/Charles law|Charles law]].

[[Physics/Thermal/Absolute Zero|Absolute Zero]] is the temperature at which pressure & volume are extrapolated back to zero. This the the minimum possible theoretical temperature, corresponding to the particles having zero [[Physics/Thermal/Internal Energy|Internal Energy]].
