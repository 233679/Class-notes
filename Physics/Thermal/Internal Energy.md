# Internal Energy
The [[Physics/Thermal/Internal Energy|Internal Energy]] energy of a body is a result of its molecules movements & positions. The [[Physics/Thermal/Internal Energy|Internal Energy]] energy of a body is sometimes referred to as [[Physics/Thermal/Internal Energy|Thermal Energy]]. However, not all [[Physics/Thermal/Internal Energy|Internal Energy]] corresponds with a change in temperature. For example, a magnetised metal has more internal energy than an equivalent non-magnetised metal.
