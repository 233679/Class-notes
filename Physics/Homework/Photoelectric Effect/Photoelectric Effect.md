A)

The plate looses it's charge, because the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the light, which is behaving as photons, interacts with the delocalized electrons on the surface on the metal plate. The delocalized electrons are at the surface of the metal plate, as each electron is negatively charged, and as they are delocalized they repel each other, causing them to evenly distribute over the surface of the metal plate.
The interaction between the photons and the electrons is a destructive one, where the photon converts all of its mass to energy & displaces the delocalized electron from the metal, having converted all of the energy from the photon into kinetic energy. The displaced electron is known as a photoelectron.
The reason that this effect only occurs above the threshold frequency, is that each photon needs a minimum amount of energy to displace the electron from the metal. However, a frequency over the threshold frequency does not increase the rate of loss of charge, as each photon only interacts with a single electron.
Intensity, however, does increase the rate of loss of charge. This is because the intensity represents the amount of photons that are incident to the metal. More photons leads to a faster loss of charge.

$E_{photon} = hf = 6.63\times10^{-34}\times1.2\times10^{15} = 8.0\times10^{-19}$
$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi$
$\phi = E_{photon} - E_{Kmax} =$
