# Photoelectron
A [[Photoelectron]] is an [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]] that is released from the surface of a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoemissive Surface|Photoemissive Surface]] when a [[../Particles/Photon|Photon]] is incident.

The relationship between a [[Physics/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] of a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectron|Photoelectron]] & the [[Physics/Frequency|Frequency]] of the incident light is shown by this graph:

$f_{min}$ = [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Threshold Frequency|Threshold Frequency]].
