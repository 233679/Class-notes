# Photoelectric Effect

### Definitions
- [[Photoelectron]]
- [[Threshold Frequency]]
- [[Work Function]]

The [[Gold Leaf Experiment]] is a prime example of the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectric Effect]].

Important points:
- The [[../Electromagnetic|Electromagnetic]] radiation needs to be above the [[Threshold Frequency]] & incident to the [[Photoemissive Surface]].
- keep in mind is that the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectric Effect]] **can** occur on [[Photoemissive Surface]] that **are not** negatively charged. This is because
- The [[Work Function]]
