# Stopping Potential
[[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Stopping Potential|Stopping Potential]] is the minimum [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]] required to stop [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectron|Photoelectrons]] being released from a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoemissive Surface|Photoemissive Surface]].

Circuit to measure stopping potential, using the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Vacuum Photocell|Vacuum Photocell]]:

The [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Vacuum Photocell|Vacuum Photocell]] can be used to measure the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Stopping Potential|Stopping Potential]] of a material. By attaching a variable cell to the [[Physics/Electricity/Circuit|Circuit]], in parallel to the microammeter. The voltage can then be changed, until there is 0 current. This is the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Stopping Potential|Stopping Potential]] of the photocathode for the used electromagnetic radiation.
