# Conduction Electron
[[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electrons]] move about at random within a [[Physics/Metal|Metal]], with its [[Physics/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] depending on the temperature of the [[Physics/Metal|Metal]].
Similar to a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoemissive Surface|Photoemissive Surface]], [[Physics/Metal|Metals]] have a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]], which is about the [[Physics/Order Of Magnitude|Order Of Magnitude]] of $10^{-19}$[[Physics/Joules|Joules]]. When a [[Physics/Metal|Metal]] is at 300[[Physics/Thermal/Kelvin|Kelvin]] the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]] of [[Physics/Metal|Metal]] is about 20 times greater than the [[Physics/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] of the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]].
If a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]] is [[Physics/Incident|Incident]] to a [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]], that is above the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Threshold Frequency|Threshold Frequency]], then the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]] will get released from the [[Physics/Metal|Metal]] & become a [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Photoelectron|Photoelectron]]. If energy of the [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] is bellow the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Work Function|Work Function]], then the [[Physics/Photoelectric Effect/Conduction Electron|Conduction Electron]] will stay within the [[Physics/Metal|Metal]] & quickly lose its extra energy via collisions with other sub-atomic particles.
