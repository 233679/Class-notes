# Gravitational Fields
A Gravitational Field is the area around an object with mass, in which other masses will experience a force towards the objects centre of mass. This is because gravitational fields are [[Unsorted/Vector|Vector]] fields, whose direction is towards the objects centre of mass.

### Field Diagrams
The green lines in the diagrams are field lines. They determine both the strength & direction of a field, with the direction of the lines determining the direction of the field & the number of lines in an area determining the strength of the field.
##### Radial Field
![[Physics/Gravitational Fields/Gravitational Fields - Radial Field.png]]
A Radial Field is a gravitational field around a point (or spherical) mass. E.G. A planet or a star.
Since the gravitational field acts towards the centre of mass, any mass can be modelled as point mass with a radial field, if viewed at a sufficient scale (even entire galaxies!).

##### Parallel Field

A Parallel Field is a gravitational field at the surface of a massive planet or moon. Since the curvature of the surface is negligible (at this scale) it can be modelled as a flat surface.

### Force Calculations
Using Newton's law of gravitation, the forces between two point masses can be quantified using the formula "$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$" where:
$F$/N = The force experienced
$G$/$Nm^2{kg}^{-2}$ = The gravitational **constant** (in the data sheet)
$m_1$/kg = The mass of object 1
$m_2$/kg = The mass of object 2
$r$/m = The distance between the centre of mass of object 1 & object 2.

### Gravitational Field Strength
Gravitational Field Strength is "the gravitational force per kg on a test mass (a mass with a negligible gravitational field) at a point in a field".

Since only one gravitational field is present, the formula can be simplified to "$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$" (on data sheet) where:
$g$ = Force per unit on the test mass
$G$/$Nm^2{kg}^{-2}$ = The gravitational **constant** (in the data sheet)
$M$/kg = The mass of the object with a gravitational field
$r$/m = The distance between the centre of mass of $M$ & the test mass
