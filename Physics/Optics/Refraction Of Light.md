# Refraction Of Light
The reflection & refraction of light can be explained by using the standard wave theory of light. However, it is more convenient to create diagrams using light rays & normals when demonstrating the effect of lenses or mirrors on that path of light.
Light rays represent the direction of travel of wavefronts.
