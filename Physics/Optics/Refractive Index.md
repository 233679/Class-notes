# Refractive Index
The refractive index of a substance can be found by using the formula "$n = \frac{sin(i)}{sin(r)}$" (**not** in data sheet) where:
$n$ = The refractive index (of the entered substance)
$i$ = The angle of incidence (from the [[Physics/Optics/Normal|Normal]])
$r$ = The angle of refraction (from the [[Physics/Optics/Normal|Normal]])

An experiment to find the refractive index of glass is shown bellow

The $i$ & $r$ shown in the diagram are the same as listed in the formula above.

Additionally, the angle of refraction ($r$) at "P" is always less than angle of incidence ($i$).

### Parallel Sides
When a light ray exits a substance from a side that is parallel to its entry, then it can be observed that the angle of incidence when entering the substance ($i_1$) is equal to the angle of refraction when exiting the substance ($r_2$). Furthermore, the angle of refraction when entering the substance ($r_1$), is equal to the angle of incidence when exiting the substance ($i_2$).

Written as an equation:
$i_1 = r_2$
$r_1 = i_2$
