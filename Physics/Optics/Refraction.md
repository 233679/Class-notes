# Refraction
Refraction is the resulting change of direction due to light traversing at an angle across a boundary between two transparent substances.

At a boundary between two transparent substances, the light ray bends:
- Towards the [[Physics/Optics/Normal|Normal]] if it passes into a more dense substance
- Away from the [[Physics/Optics/Normal|Normal]] if it passes into a less dense substance.
