# Excitation
[[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excitation]] is a process where an [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] (or [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]]) collides with an [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] bound to an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] & causes it to move to a higher energy band, with the unbound electron expending a portion of its [[Physics/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] to do so.
However, this process can only occur at **specific** energies known as **excitation energies**, which are unique to each [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]]. This is critical when when an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] is [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excited]] by a [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]], as all the energy of the [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] will be used to to move the electron to an outer [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]].
