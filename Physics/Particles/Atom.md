# Atom
[[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]] are comprised of [Neutrons](Neutron.md), [Protons](Proton.md), & [Electrons](Electron.md). The number of [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] & [[Physics/Particles/Proton|Protons]] in a [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] is identical, as [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]] always have a neutral charge. If an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] was to lose/gain an [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]]/[[Physics/Particles/Proton|Proton]], then it would become an [[Physics/Particles/Ion|Ion]].

When an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] absorbs energy, usually while in its [[Unsorted/Ground State|Ground State]], either [[Physics/Particles/Ionisation|Ionisation]] or [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excitation]] could occur.

Many models have been used to define the [Atom](Atom.md), with their accuracy increasing over time.
