# Bartons Pendulums
Barton's pendulums is an experiment that demonstrates resonance.

The experiment is set up as shown:
![[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Bartons Pendulums - diagram.png]]
A to E are light pendulums, X is a heavy pendulum (This is the driving pendulum). When the driving pendulum is oscillating, it displaces the string it is connected to. This acts as a forced oscillation on the light pendulums.
Most of the light pendulums have small oscillations, as the forced oscillation doesn't match the natural oscillation of the pendulum.
##### Undamped
However, pendulum C, will oscillation with a much larger amplitude as the forced oscillation from X matches the natural oscillation/resonant frequency of the pendulum. This is because they have the same length.
##### Damped
If the light pendulums are damped, then a pendulum with a shorter string can resonate with the forced oscillation, rather than the pendulum with the same length.
