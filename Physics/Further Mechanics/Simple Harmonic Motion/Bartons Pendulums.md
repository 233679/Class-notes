# Bartons Pendulums
Barton's pendulums is an experiment that demonstrates resonance.

The experiment is set up as shown:
![[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Bartons Pendulums - diagram.png]]
A to E are light pendulums, X is a heavy pendulum (This is the driving pendulum). When the driving pendulum is oscillating, it displaces the string it is connected to. This acts as a forced oscillation on the light pendulums.
Most of the light pendulums have small oscillations, as the forced oscillation doesn't match the natural oscillation of the pendulum.
##### Undamped
However, pendulum C, will oscillation with a much larger amplitude as the forced oscillation from X matches the natural oscillation/resonant frequency of the pendulum. This is because they have the same length.
##### Damped
If the light pendulums are damped, then a pendulum with a shorter string can resonate with the forced oscillation, rather than the pendulum with the same length.

### Phase difference
Systems do not necessarily oscillate in phase with the driving force.

(The line in the middle is the natural frequency)

1: At very low frequencies (from the forced oscillation), the phase difference between the pendulums is "$\Delta\phi = 0$rads".
2: At frequencies around the natural frequencies, the phase different between the pendulums is "$\Delta\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$".
3: At frequencies much higher than the natural frequency, the phase difference between the pendulums is "$\Delta\phi = \pi$rads".
