The oscillations for [[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Simple Harmonic Motion|Simple Harmonic Motion]] traces out a sinusoidal (looks like a sine wave) graph, if the displacement is mapped to time.

In [[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Simple Harmonic Motion|Simple Harmonic Motion]], the more an object is displaced from the equilibrium, the faster it accelerates towards the equilibrium. This relationship is ***directly proportional***.
### Examples
##### Pendulum
One complete oscillation is for the pendulum to fully swing from one side & then back.
