# Simple Harmonic Motion
An object can be described as having [[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Simple Harmonic Motion|Simple Harmonic Motion]] if it follows the formula "$a \propto -x$" where "$a$" is acceleration & "$x$" is the displacement from the equilibrium. Expressed in words, the more an object is displaced from the equilibrium, the faster it accelerates towards the equilibrium. This relationship is ***directly proportional***.

Expressed as a graph:

The full formula for "$a \propto - x$" is "$a = -\omega^2 x$". This can be found on the data sheet.

### Displacement per Unit time
When the displacement from the equilibrium is mapped against time, a sinusoidal (looks like a sine wave) graph is produced.

This graph follows the formula "$x = A cos(\omega t)$" (on data sheet) where "$x$" is displacement & "$A$" is amplitude. "$\omega$" is a measurement of how much of an oscillation is completed per unit time.

If the mass that produces this graph in increased, the time period of the graph also increases.

### Velocity per Unit time
When the velocity is mapped against time, a sinusoidal (again) graph is produced.![[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Simple Harmonic Motion - Velocity per unit time.png]]
This graph follows the formula "$v = -\omega A sin(\omega t)$", with the variables being the same to the displacement per unit time graph.
The maximum velocity can be found by "$v_{max} = \omega A$".

A key difference between the velocity graph & the displacement graph is that the velocity graph starts at 0, whereas the displacement graph starts at "$x_{max}$". This is because when a simple harmonic system is at its maximum displacement its velocity is at 0, as it has just changed direction back towards the equilibrium.

### Examples
##### Pendulum
One complete oscillation is for the pendulum to fully swing from one side & then back.

One complete oscillation for the mass on a spring is:
