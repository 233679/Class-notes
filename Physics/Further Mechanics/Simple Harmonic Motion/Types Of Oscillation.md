# Types Of Oscillation
### Free Oscillation
Free oscillations are how simple harmonic motion occurs in theory. Where the oscillations continue forever, as no energy is dissipated.
### Damped Oscillations
Damps oscillations is how mechanical SHM occurs in reality, as energy is transferred to the surrounding environment with each oscillation, by forces such as friction & air resistance.

### Forced Oscillation
Forced oscillation is caused by periodic forces acting upon on SHM system.
Examples:
- Child pushed on a swing.
- Rocking.
- Pirate ship theme park ride.
- Boat on waves.
- Bridge (In the wind).
Forced oscillation doesn't have to occur at the natural frequency of a SHM system, although if the forced frequency is the same as the natural frequency then the amplitude of the oscillation will be very large. It can be said the pendulum is being driven at its **resonant frequency**.

##### Natural Frequency
Forced oscillation can cause resonance if the frequency of the applied force is equal to the natural oscillation frequency of the SHM system. The natural frequency of a system is the frequency produced from oscillating without any external forces.
Resonance means that a system is experiencing maximum amplitude & energy transferred into itself from a periodic forced.
