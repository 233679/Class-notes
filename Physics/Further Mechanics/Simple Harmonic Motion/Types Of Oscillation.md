# Types Of Oscillation
### Free oscillation
Free oscillations are how simple harmonic motion occurs in theory. Where the oscillations continue forever, as no energy is dissipated.
### Damped oscillations
Damps oscillations is how mechanical SMH occurs in reality, as energy is transferred to the surrounding environment with each oscillation, by forces such as friction & air resistance.

### Forced oscillation
Forced oscillation is caused by periodic forces acting upon on SMH system.
Examples:
- Child pushed on a swing.
- Rocking.
- Pirate ship theme park ride.
- Boat on waves.
- Bridge (In the wind).

##### Natural frequency
Forced oscillation can cause resonance if the frequency of the applied force is equal to the natural oscillation frequency of the SMH system. The natural frequency of a system is the frequency produced from oscillating without any external forces.
Resonance means that a system is experiencing maximum amplitude & energy transferred into itself from a periodic forced.
