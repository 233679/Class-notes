### Unit over time
The graphs for "$x/t$" (displacement / time), "$v/t$" (velocity / time), & "$a/t$" (acceleration / time) , can be derived sequentially from each other using the gradient of the previous graph as the y of the next graph. Mathematically:
"$y = mx$" & "$m = y_{next}$"
"$=> m = y/x$"
"$=> m/time = y_{next}/time$"

### Velocity over time
Plotting velocity over time gives this graph:

This formula for this graph is "$v = \pm \sqrt{(A^2 - x^2)}$", which is given in the data sheet. This is the formula for the oval with the suitable variables substituted in.
As annotated on the graph, "$v_{max} = \omega A$" & "$v_{min} = -\omega A$".
