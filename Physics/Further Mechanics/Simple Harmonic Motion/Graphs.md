### Unit over time
The graphs for "$x/t$" (displacement / time), "$v/t$" (velocity / time), & "$a/t$" (acceleration / time) , can be derived sequentially from each other using the gradient of the previous graph as the y of the next graph. Mathematically:
"$y = mx$" & "$m = y_{next}$"
"$=> m = y/x$"
"$=> m/time = y_{next}/time$"

Another item of note is that each graph shares the same time period for a full wave cycle.

Energy can also be mapped against time.

### Unit over Displacement

##### Velocity

This formula for this graph is "$v = \pm \sqrt{(A^2 - x^2)}$", which is given in the data sheet. This is the formula for the oval with the suitable variables substituted in.
As annotated on the graph, "$v_{max} = \omega A$" & "$v_{min} = -\omega A$".

### Pendulum
If a pendulum is experiencing Simple Harmonic Motion, mapping "$T^2$" over "$l$" will produce this graph:
![[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Graphs - T2 over l.png]]
The formula for a pendulum is "$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$" (This is given in the data sheet). This can be rearranged into "$y = mx$".
$=> T = (\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{g}})\times\sqrt{l}$
$=> T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{g}\times l$
Where:
$y = T^2$
$m = \frac{4\pi^2}{g}$
$x = l$

### Spring
If a mass-spring-system is experiencing Simple Harmonic Motion, then plotting "$T^2$" over "$m$" will result in this graph:
![[Physics/Further Mechanics/Simple Harmonic Motion/Graphs - T2 over m.png]]
The formula for a mass-spring-system is "$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$", this is given in the data sheet. This formula can be rearranged into "$y = mx$" to produce the above graph.
$=> T = (\frac{2\pi^2}{\sqrt{k}})\times\sqrt{m}$
$=> T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{k}\times m$
Where:
$y = T^2$
$m = \frac{4\pi^2}{k}$
$x = m$
