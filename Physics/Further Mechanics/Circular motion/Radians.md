# Radians
[[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Radians|Radians]] are the angle subtended by an arc who's length is that of the circles radius. Radians (rad for short) are a measurement of angles.

### Conversions
Where:
$x = \degree$
$y =$ rad

To Radians:
$\frac{x\pi}{180} = y$

From Radians:
$\frac{180y}{\pi} = x$
