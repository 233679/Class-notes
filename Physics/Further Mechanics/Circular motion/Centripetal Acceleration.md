# Centripetal Acceleration
When moving in a circular path, an object moves at a constant speed, but not a constant acceleration. This is because the object is constantly changing direction to follow the circular path, which is a result of constant acceleration towards to centre of the circle.

This acceleration is referred to as [[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Centripetal Acceleration|Centripetal Acceleration]]. Which is given by the formula:
$a = \frac{v^2}{r}$
Where:
a = acceleration.
v = velocity.
r = The radius of the circle.
