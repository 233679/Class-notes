# Centripetal Force
[[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Centripetal Force|Centripetal Force]] is a **resultant** force acting on objects with a circular motion (objects experiencing [[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Centripetal Acceleration|Centripetal Acceleration]]). This is given by the formula:
$a = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
Where:
a = acceleration
m = mass
v = velecoity
r = radius
