# Angular Speed
[[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Angular Speed|Angular Speed]] is the speed experienced by an object traveling along a circular path & is measured in [[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Radians|Radians]] per second (rad$s^{-1}$). Angular speed is given by the formula:
$\omega = \frac{v}{r}$
$\omega$ =[[Physics/Further Mechanics/Circular motion/Angular Speed|Angular Speed]]
v = velocity (could also be called linear velocity.)
r = radius
