# Louis De Broglie
Predicted the wave-like nature of matter, that [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] could be diffracted. This is called [[Wave-Particle Duality]].

Part of [[Physics/Louis de Broglie|de Broglies]] predication was that the [[Physics/Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]] of matter follows this formula:
$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$

$\lambda$ = [[Physics/Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]]
$h$ = [[Physics/Planck Constant|Planck Constant]]
$p$ = [[Physics/Momentum|Momentum]]
