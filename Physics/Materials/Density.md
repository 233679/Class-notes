# Density
[[Density]] is a measure of an object / materials mass per unit volume. To measure [[Density]] measure the mass of equal volumes of the two materials. The material with the greater mass is more [[Density|Dense]].

This can be expressed in the formula:
$\rho = m / V$

$\rho$ - density (in $kgm^{-3}$)
$m$ - mass
$V$ - volume

### Alloys
To calculate the [[Density]] of [[../Alloy|Alloys]] you have to. #Todo
