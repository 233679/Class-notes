# Strain Energy
[[Strain Energy]] is the work done to deform a material.

Example:

The work done to stretch the material is represented by the area under the loading curve.
The work done by the material when unloading is represented by the area under the unloading curve.
The area between the two curves represents the energy dissipated between the loading & unloading.
