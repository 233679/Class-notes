# Young Modulus

Young's Modulus = [[Tensile Stress]] / Tensile strain = $\frac{T}{A} \div \frac{\Delta L}{L}$ = $\frac{FL}{A \Delta L}$

T - tension
F - Force
L - Starting Length
A - Cross sectional area
$\Delta$L - Change in length

The symbol for [[Young Modulus]] is $E_y$. It's usually measured in pascals $Pa$
