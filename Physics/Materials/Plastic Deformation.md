# Plastic Deformation
[[Plastic Deformation]] is when a material is pushed past [[Elastic Deformation]]. [[Plastic Deformation]] permanently changes the resting shape of the material.

In [[Plastic Deformation]], more energy will be dissipated than in [[Elastic Deformation]]. As a decent amount of "energy" is used to deform the material, instead of being returned.
