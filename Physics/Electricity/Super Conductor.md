# Super Conductor
[Super Conductors](Super%20Conductor.md) are materials that have **0** [Resistance](../../Electronics/Ohms%20law/Resistance.md) at or bellow the [Critical Temperature](Critical%20Temperature.md) of the [Super Conductors](Super%20Conductor.md). The [Critical Temperature](Critical%20Temperature.md) of known [Super Conductor](Super%20Conductor.md) is extremely low, (an example temperature is $-270^oC$).

A disadvantage is the huge cost to keep the [Super Conductor](Super%20Conductor.md) at its [Critical Temperature](Critical%20Temperature.md).

An advantage is that there is no energy dissipated by the [Current](../../Electronics/Ohms%20law/Current.md) moving through the [Super Conductor](Super%20Conductor.md).

Two uses for [Super Conductors](Super%20Conductor.md) is in MRI machines & Maglev trains.
