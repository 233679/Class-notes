# Semiconductor
A [[Semiconductor|Semiconductors]] behaviour is weird. At low temperatures it acts like an [[Insulator]]. However, at higher temperatures, it acts like a [[Conductor]]. This is because [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] break free from the [[../Particles/Atom|Atoms]] of the [[Semiconductor]] as the temperature increases. Causing the resistance of the [[Semiconductor]] to decrease as the temperature increases.
