# Potential Difference
[[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]] is the work done between two points per [[Physics/Electricity/Coulomb|Coulomb]]. [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|P.D]] is measured in [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Volts]]. One [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Volt]] is equal to one [[Physics/Joules|Joule]] per [[Physics/Electricity/Coulomb|Coulomb]] - $1V = 1JC^{-1}$.

Formula:

$V = \frac{W}{Q}$

$V$ - [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Volts]]
$W$ - Work done
$Q$ - [[Physics/Electricity/Coulomb|Coulombs]]
