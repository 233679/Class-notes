# Critical Temperature
The [Critical Temperature](Critical%20Temperature.md) is the temperature at which certain materials being to exhibit [Super Conductor](Super%20Conductor.md) behaviours.

There are two main types of [Critical Temperature](Critical%20Temperature.md) that determine the classification of a [Super Conductor](Super%20Conductor.md). Bellow $30K$, a [Super Conductor](Super%20Conductor.md) is consider low-temperature. Above
