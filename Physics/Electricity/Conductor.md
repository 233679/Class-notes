# Conductor
In a metallic [[Conductor]], most [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are bound to [[../Particles/Atom|Atoms]]. However, there are some delocalised [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]], these [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are the charge carriers within the metal. Allowing the metal to be a [[Conductor]] as the delocalised [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] will react to a Voltage.
