# Electrical Conduction
For current to flow around a circuit the circuit must be unbroken & there must be a source of potential difference.
In metals the charge is conducted by [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]].
In salt solutions, the charge is carried by [[Irons]] instead of [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]].

This is a simple circuit for showing the conduction of [[Electricity]]. The electrons are pushed from the positively charged side of the battery, though the circuit to the negatively charged side. If current is flowing in this circuit then the meter will read a non-zero value. If no current is flowing then the meter will read 0. This meter is called an [[Physics/Electricity/Ammeter]], this is because is measures the [[Amps]] (current).

Counter intuitively, the convention for current is that it flows from the positive charge to the negative charge. This is because the convention for current was defined before electrons flowing from negative to positive was understood.
