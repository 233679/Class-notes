# Intensity
[[Physics/Intensity|Intensity]] is a measurement of [[Power]] transmitted over an area over a time.

[[Physics/Intensity|Intensity]] can be calculated with the formula:
$I = \frac{P}{A}$

$I$ = [[Physics/Intensity|Intensity]]
$P$ = [[Physics/Power|Power]]
A = The cross-section which the power is flowing over.
