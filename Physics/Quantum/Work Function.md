# Work Function
The [[Work Function]] is the **minimum** amount of energy needed by an [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]] to escape a surface [[Photoemissive Surface]]. Any energy left over after the [[Work Function]] is subtracted is the kinetic energy of the emitted [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]].
However, since the [[Work Function]] is the **minimum** amount of energy, some [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] will require more energy to be displaced, as they are further from the surface.

The [[Work Function]] is measured in [[../Joules|Joules]], and represented by the symbol $\phi$.

The [[Work Function]] can be calculated with these formula:

$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi$
$E_K$ - Maximum kinetic energy an [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]] could have.
$hf$ - Energy of the [[../Particles/Photon|Photon]].
$\phi$ - [[Work Function]].

$\phi  = hf_{threshold}$
$\phi$ - [[Work Function]].
$h$ - [[../Planck Constant|Planck Constant]].
$f_{threshold}$ - [[Threshold Frequency]].
