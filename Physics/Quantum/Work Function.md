# Work Function
The [[Work Function]] is the minimum amount of energy needed by an [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]] to escape the surface of the metal. Any energy left over after the [[Work Function]] is subtracted is the kinetic energy of the emitted [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]].

The [[Work Function]] is measured in [[../Joules|Joules]], and represented by the symbol $\phi$.

The [[Work Function]] can be calculated with the formula:

$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi$
$E_K$ - Max kinetic energy.
$hf$ - Energy of the photon.
$\phi$ - [[Work Function]].
