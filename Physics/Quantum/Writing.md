The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency at which a photon has enough energy to release an photoelectron from a photoemissive surface.

The work function is the minimum amount of energy a photon can have to release a photoelectron from a photoemissive surface.

The photoelectric equation defines the how much kinetic energy a photoelectron will have after it has been released. If the equation gives a negative number, then an electron won't be emitted from the surface.
