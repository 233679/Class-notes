# Absorption Spectrum
When a gas [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] is [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excited]] by a [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] it will use all of the energy of the [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]], leaving nothing behind. This causes gaps in the light spectrum where the [[Physics/Quantum/Emission Line|Emission Lines]] within an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] are.
