# Gold Leaf Experiment

[[../../TODO|TODO]] add ray diagram.

With negative charges in a mental, the negative charge "spreads" through the metal, as the negative charges repel each other.

### UV light
When [[../Light/Ultra Violet|Ultra Violet]] light is incident to the gold leaf:
- The gold leaf 'drops'.
- [[../Electrostatic|Electrostatic]] force has decreased.
- The system has discharged

### Why Does it Drop in UV light
**Key Observations:**
- Metal discharges if the [[../Frequency|Frequency]] of incident [[../Electromagnetic|Electromagnetic]] radiation.
- The discharge begins instantly.
- The rate of discharge depends on the [[../Intensity|Intensity]] of radiation. Measured in ($Wm^{-2}$) or ($Js^{-1}m^{-2}$).
- The rate of discharge does not depend on the frequency of the [[../Electromagnetic|Electromagnetic]] radiation.

### Energy Transfer

[[../../TODO|TODO]] ray image

$\frac{hc}{\lambda} = hf$
This represents the energy of a photon.

The [[../Electromagnetic|Electromagnetic]] energy doesn't behave as a wave in this situation. This is because if the [[../Frequency|Frequency]] is increased, the rate of charge doesn't change.

### Why Does This Occur
Each [[../Photon|Photon]] with **enough energy** releases one electron.
- More [[../Photon|Photons]] per second leads to a faster discharge (more [[Photoelectron|Photoelectrons]] emitted per unit of time).
- Higher [[../Frequency|Frequency]] has the same rate of discharge, even though the [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] have more energy.

### Own words:
When a [[../Light/Ultra Violet|Ultra Violet]] light is incident to a negatively charged metal, the [[../Electromagnetic|Electromagnetic]] radiation (acting as a [[../Photon|Photon]]) the [[../Photon|Photons]] interact with the negatively charged [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]], which are pushed to the surface by [[../Electromagnetic|Electromagnetic]] repulsion. The interaction between the [[../Photon|Photons]] & the [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] releases the [[../Particles/Electron|Electron]] from the metal, by overcoming the [[../Electrostatic|Electrostatic]] attraction between the delocalized electron & the metal irons. The released [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are labelled as [[Photoelectron|Photoelectrons]]. As more [[../Particles/Electron|Electrons]] are released, there is less [[../Electrostatic|Electrostatic]] repulsion supporting the golden leaf.
