# Emission Spectrum

An [[Physics/Particles/Excitation|Excited]] gas [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] will emit a [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photon]] when it's [[Unsorted/De-Excitation|De-Excited]], with one [[Physics/Quantum/Emission Line|Emission Line]] per transition option. The [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photons]] emitted will correspond to the energy released by moving to a lower [[Unsorted/Shell|Shell]]. This produces exact wavelengths of [[Physics/Particles/Photon|Photons]].
