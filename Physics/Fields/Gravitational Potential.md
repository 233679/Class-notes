# Gravitational Potential

### Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy of an object due to its position within a [[Physics/Fields/Gravitational Fields|Gravitational Field]]. If an object was infinitely far away (so that its gravitational field is negligible), its GPE would be zero. The closer to the centre of mass an object is, the lower the GPE is, with it being negative on the surface of the Earth (for example).
The formula for GPE is "$U = mgh$", where
$U$ = Gravitational Potential Energy
$m$/kg = mass of the object
$g$/ms$^{-2}$ = [[Physics/Fields/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Field Strength|Gravitational Field Strength]]
$h$/m = height

### Gravitational Potential
Gravitational potential is the work done per unit mass that is **required** to move a [[Physics/Fields/Test Mass|Test Mass]] from infinity to a point. This is because the work done to move an object to that point is equal to the GPE per unit mass of a [[Physics/Fields/Test Mass|Test Mass]] at the point in a [[Physics/Fields/Gravitational Fields|Gravitational Field]].
This can be written as the formula "$V = \frac{W}{m}$", where:
$V$/J${kg}^{-1}$ = Gravitational Potential
$W$ = Work done
$m$ = The mass of the object
All gravitational potentials are negative ("$V < 0$"), as gravity is **only** attractive. Therefore energy is released as the [[Physics/Fields/Test Mass|Test Mass]] gets closer to the mass.

### Gravitational Potential Difference
[[#Gravitational Potential Difference]] is the energy per unit mass required to move a small test mass from one point to another point.

### Potential Gradients
The potential gradient is the change of potential per metre at a point in a [[Physics/Fields/Gravitational Fields|Gravitational Field]]. As an object moves away from the centre of a [[Physics/Fields/Gravitational Fields|Gravitational Field]] the ratio between the distance moved & the change in GPE decreases.
The potential gradient can be derived from "$\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta r}$", where
$V$ = the change of potential
$r$ = the distance

Furthermore, [[Physics/Fields/Gravitational Fields#Gravitational Field Strength|Gravitational Field Strength]] can be derived from almost the same equation (**only when the force on the object is constant**) "$g = -\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta r}$", where
$g$ = Gravitational Field Strength
$V$ = the change of potential
$r$ = the distance

It can be said that the relationship between "$V$" is inversely proportional to the distance "$r$" from the centre of the planet.
