# Gravitational Fields
A Gravitational Field is the area around an object with mass, in which other masses will experience a force towards the objects centre of mass. This is because gravitational fields are [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]] fields, whose direction is towards the objects centre of mass.

### Field Diagrams
The green lines in the diagrams are field lines. They determine both the strength & direction of a field, with the direction of the lines determining the direction of the field & the number of lines in an area determining the strength of the field.
##### Radial Field

A Radial Field is a gravitational field around a point (or spherical) mass. E.G. A planet or a star.
Since the gravitational field acts towards the centre of mass, any mass can be modelled as point mass with a radial field, if viewed at a sufficient scale (even entire galaxies!).

##### Parallel Field

A Parallel Field is a gravitational field at the surface of a massive planet or moon. Since the curvature of the surface is negligible (at this scale) it can be modelled as a flat surface.

### Force Calculations
Using Newton's law of gravitation, the forces between two point masses can be quantified using the formula "$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$" where:
$F$/N = The force experienced
$G$/$Nm^2{kg}^{-2}$ = The gravitational **constant** (in the data sheet)
$m_1$/kg = The mass of object 1
$m_2$/kg = The mass of object 2
$r$/m = The distance between the centre of mass of object 1 & object 2.

### Gravitational Field Strength
Gravitational Field Strength is "the gravitational force per kg on a [[Physics/Fields/Test Mass|Test Mass]] at a point in a field".

As the test mass has a negligible gravitation field, the formula can be simplified from "$g = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$" ("$m$" being the test mass) to "$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$" (on data sheet) where:
$g$/$N{kg}^{-1}$ = Force per unit on the test mass
$G$/$Nm^2{kg}^{-2}$ = The gravitational **constant** (in the data sheet)
$M$/kg = The mass of the object with a gravitational field
$r$/m = The distance between the centre of mass of $M$ & the test mass

**This equation is only true if "$r$" is >= than the radius of "$M$".**

This diagram shows the scenario:

##### When Working with Planets
Rearranging the formula "$g_s = \frac{GM}{R^2}$" (with "$R$" as the radius of the planet)
$=> GM = g_sR^2$
$=> g = \frac{g_sR^2}{r^2}$
Where:
$g$ = gravitational field strength
$g_s$ = gravitational field strength **at the surface of the planet**
$R$ = radius of the planet
$r$ = the distance from the centre of the planet

This formula can be used to plot of how "$g$" changes with distances from the centre of a planet.

Two notable points is that "$g$" is 0 at the centre of the planet, as the mass of the planet is equal in all direction so the resultant force totals to 0. And is the highest at the surface of the planet.
