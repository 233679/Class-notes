# Electrical Field
[[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charged]] objects exert equal & opposite forces on each other, even if they are not directly in contact. This is due to an electrical field surrounding the charge.

## Field Types

The potential energy change ("$\Delta E_p$") exerted by a uniform or radial field is given by "$\Delta E_p = \frac{Q}{V}$" where:
$\Delta E_p$ = Change in potential energy
$Q$ = The charge of the object within the field
$V$ = The [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]] between the plates in the field
This is in the data sheet as "$\Delta W = Q \Delta V$".
### Uniform Field

A uniform field can be created between two large parallel metal plates, which are a relatively small distance apart. In a uniform field, the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Field Line|Field Lines]] are parallel to each other, except for at the edges of the field where they deviate outwards slightly.

The formula "$E = \frac{V}{d}$" is **only true** within a uniform field, with:
$E$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]]
$V$ = [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Voltage]] difference between the two plates
$d$ = Distance between the two plates
Furthermore, the value of "$E$" is a local constant within the uniform field.
### Radial Field

Isolated point charges produce an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electric Field]], which can be modelled as a radial field.

The [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]] of a radial field varies, with the strength decreasing with distance from the centre. To calculate the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]] of a radial field, "$E = \frac{F}{Q}$" can be substituted into "$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\times\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$" to give the formula:
$E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\times\frac{Q}{r^2}$
Where:
$E$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]]
$\epsilon_0$ = [[Physics/The Permittivity Of Free Space|The Permittivity Of Free Space]]
$Q$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] of the isolated point
$r$ = Distance from the centre of the isolated point

The [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]] within a radial field is given by the equation (in data sheet):
$V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\times\frac{Q}{r}$
Where:
$V$ = [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]]
$\epsilon_0$ = [[Physics/The Permittivity Of Free Space|The Permittivity Of Free Space]]
$Q$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] of the isolated point
$r$ = Distance from the centre of the isolated point
**Remember: This formula uses "$r$", not "$r^2$".**
## Example Fields
### Opposite Charge Points
(two radial fields)
The field lines are concentrated at each point.

### Point near Plate
(a uniform & radial field)
The field lines are concentrated at the point & are at rights angles to the plate.

### Opposite Charged Plates
(two uniform fields)
The field lines are parallel to each other (except at the edge of the field), producing a uniform field between the two plates.
