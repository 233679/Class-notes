# Electrical Field
Charged objects exert equal & opposite forces on each other, even if they are not directly in contact. This is due to an electrical field surrounding the charge.

### Example Fields
#### Opposite Charged
The field lines are concentrated at each point.

#### Point near Plate
The field lines are concentrated at the point & are at rights angles to the plate.

#### Opposite Charged Plates
The field lines are parallel to each other (except at the edge of the field), producing a uniform field between the two plates.
