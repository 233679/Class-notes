# Charge
Two charged objects of the same material will repel each other. However, two charged objects of different materials will attract each other. In short:
**Like charges repel; Unlike charges attract**

An objects charge is caused by the [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]] within the object, similar to how electrons causes [[Physics/Particles/Ion|Ions]] to be positively or negatively charged. An solid without any charge contains an equal number of protons & electrons. A negatively charged solid contains less electrons, with positively charged solid contains more electrons (both relative to the uncharged solid).

For an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Conductor|Electrical Conductor]] to be charged, it has be to isolated from the Earth by an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Insulator|Electrical Insulator]], otherwise the charge will become neutralised by electrons transferring from the material into the Earth.

[[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] is measured in [[Physics/Electricity/Coulomb|Coulombs]]
