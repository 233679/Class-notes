# Electrical Insulator
An Electrical Insulator is a material that doesn't contain any free [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electrons]]. All the electrons are attached to [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]].

However, if an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Insulator|Electrical Insulator]] is subjected to an extremely strong [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electric Field]], then the [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atoms]] that compose an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Insulator|Electrical Insulator]] will become [[Physics/Particles/Ionisation|Ironised]] & result in the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Insulator|Electric Insulator]] acting as an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Conductor|Electrical Conductor]].
