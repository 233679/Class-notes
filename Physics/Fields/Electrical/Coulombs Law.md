# Coulombs Law
Opposite charges attract and similar charges repel with forces which are proportional to:
- The product of the charges of the objects.
- The inverse square of their distances.

It has lots of similarities to newtons law of gravity.

The force produced by electric charges is represented by the formula (on data sheet):
$$F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\times\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$
Where:
$F$ = [[Physics/Mechanics/Force|Force]]
$\epsilon_0$ = [[Physics/The Permittivity Of Free Space|The Permittivity Of Free Space]]
$Q_n$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] on each object
$r$ = Distance between the centre of each object

The force value given by this equation can be either negative or positive, with negative values representing a repulsive force & positive values representing a attritive force.

The "$\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$" part of the equation has a constant value of "$\approx 8.99\times10^9$", which is very large, as electric forces are many orders of magnitude stronger than gravitational ones. However, over larger distances the effect of electrostatic forces is greatly diminished by the *inverse square law*, with the force given being quartered for a doubling of the distance. Furthermore, the random arrangement of charges can cancel out over these large distances, further reducing the effect of electrostatic force on the macro scale.
