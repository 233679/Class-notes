# Electric Field Strength
[[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]] is defined exactly as:
"The force per unit charge on a positive [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Test Charge|Test Charge]] placed at that point."
This is a definition that needs to be remembered.

[[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]] is represented by the unit "$E$" & measured in "$NC^{-1}$".

The [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]] for a small [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Test Charge|Test Charge]] is given by the equation "$E = \frac{F}{Q}$" where:
$E$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]]
$F$ = The force acting upon [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Test Charge|Test Charge]] due to the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electric Field]]
$Q$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] of the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Test Charge|Test Charge]]
(Is given in data sheet as "$F = EQ$")
### Two Parallel Plates
The Between two oppositely charged flat conductors there is an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electric Field]] comprised of a uniform set of [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Field Line|Field Lines]].

The [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Field Line|Field Lines]] are:
- Parallel to each other.
- At rights angles to the plates.
- From the positive plate to the negative plate.

The [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]] can be calculated with the formula:
$E = \frac{V}{d}$
Where:
$E$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]]
$V$ = Voltage between the plates
$d$ = Distance between the places

### Field Factors
For any [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charged]] metal conductor, the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] is spread out evenly across its surface. Due to [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] causing [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electric Fields]], the distribution of [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] within a material influences the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electric Field]], this influence is defined by the formula:
$E = \frac{Q}{A}$
Where:
$E$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]]
$Q$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] on the surface of the area
$A$ = Surface area

### Constant Of Proportionality
The constant Of Proportionality is $\epsilon_0$ (in data sheet), which can be inserted into the [[#Field Factors]] equation resulting in the formula:
$E\epsilon_0 = \frac{Q}{A}$
Where:
$E$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electric Field Strength|Electric Field Strength]]
$\epsilon_0$ = [[#Constant Of Proportionality]]
$Q$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] on the surface of the area
$A$ = Surface area

This formula does not need to be known.
