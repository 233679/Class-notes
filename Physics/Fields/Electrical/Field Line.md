# Field Line
A Field Line is the path a small positive charge would take if placed within an [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Electrical Field|Electrical Field]].
An Electrical Field is stronger when the field lines on a diagram are closer together.

[[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Field Line|Field Lines]] always flow (the direction the arrow is pointing) from a positive [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] to a negative [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]].
