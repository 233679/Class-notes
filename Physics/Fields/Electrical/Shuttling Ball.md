# Shuttling Ball
The shuttling ball experiment demonstrates that an electric current is a flow of charge. The experiment in the diagram bellow is used to prove this:

The shuttling ball is charged by the plate it is touching. However, when the ball becomes charged it is repelled from the plate across the gap to the adjacent plate, where the same process repeats.
The microammeter in the circuit shows that a current exists, as the ball carries electrons from one plate to the other.

If the ball shuttles from plate to plate at the frequency "$f$", then the time taken for each shuttle cycle is "$\frac{1}{f}$".
The average current of the circuit can be derived from:
$I = Qf = \frac{Q}{T}$
$I$ - Current
$Q$ - Charged transferred each cycle.
$f$ - Cycle frequency
$T$ - Time taken for one cycle.
