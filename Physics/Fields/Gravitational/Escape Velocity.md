# Escape Velocity
[[Physics/Fields/Gravitational/Escape Velocity|Escape Velocity]] is the minimum velocity an object needs to escape from the non-negligible influence of a field.
An example of this is the minimum velocity needed to escape from Earths gravitational field.

### Escaping from a Planet
To escape from the gravitational influence of a planet, an object needs to travel infinitely far away from the planet, as the influence of a gravitational field is 0 when an object is infinitely far away.
Therefore (assuming the object is on the planets surface) the work done is given by "$\Delta W = m\Delta V = \frac{GMm}{R}$" where:
$W$ = the work done
$G$ = gravitational constant
$M$ = mass of the planet
$m$ = mass of the object
$R$ = radius of the planet

Rearranging the equation to find the escape velocity gives "$v_{esc} = \sqrt{2gR}$" where:
$v_{esc}$ = minimum escape velocity
$g$ = gravitational field strength
$R$ = radius of the planet
