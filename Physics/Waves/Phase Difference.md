# Phase Difference
The [[Phase Difference]] is a measurement of how much one wave is shifted compared to another. [[Phase Difference]] is measured in phi ($\phi$).

If two [[Similar Waves]] have a [[Phase Difference]] of zero they are described as **in phase**. This causes [[Constructive Interference]].
If two [[Similar Waves]] have a [[Phase Difference]] of $180\phi$ they are described as **out of phase**/**anti phase**. This causes [[Destructive Interference]]
