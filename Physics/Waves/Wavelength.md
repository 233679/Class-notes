# Wavelength
[[Physics/Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]] is a measurement of the distance between two identical amplitudes of a wave. It's commonly measured in nanometres.

Formula:
$\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$

$\lambda$ = [[Physics/Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]]
$v$ = velocity
$f$ = [[Physics/Frequency|Frequency]]
