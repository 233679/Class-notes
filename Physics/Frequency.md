# Frequency
[[Physics/Frequency|Frequency]] is a measurement of how many times a wave will oscillate per second. [[Physics/Frequency|Frequency]] is measured in [[Physics/Hertz|Hertz]].

Formula:
$f =\frac{v}{\lambda}$

$f$ = [[Physics/Frequency|Frequency]] (in [[Physics/Hertz|Hertz]])
$v$ = velocity.
$\lambda$ = [[Physics/Waves/Wavelength|Wavelength]] (in meters)
