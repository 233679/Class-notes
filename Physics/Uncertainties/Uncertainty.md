# Uncertainties
[Uncertainty](Uncertainty.md) is used to measure if data is [Accurate](Accurate.md), [Reliable](Reliable.md) & [Precise](Precise.md).

To improve data Errors (affects [[Accurate|Accuracy]]) & Uncertainty (affects [[Precise|Precision]]) needs to be reduced.

## Reducing Uncertainty
[[Uncertainty|Uncertainty]] can be reduced by:

- Use equipment with a higher [[Resolution]]
- Repeat the experiment & calculate the mean average of this for your result.

## Two Types of Uncertainties

![[Absolute Uncertainty]]

![[Percentage Uncertainty]]
