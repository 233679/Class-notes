# Uncertainties
[Uncertainty](Uncertainty.md) is used to measure if data is [Accurate](Accurate.md), [Reliable](Reliable.md) & [Precise](Precise.md).

To improve data Errors (affects [[Accurate|Accuracy]]) & Uncertainty (affects [[Precise|Precision]]) needs to be reduced.

## Number Of Measurements
The uncertainty of a measurement/reading is the base uncertainty multiplied by the number of readings/measurements.
#### Reading
When measuring a value if the value is measured once then the uncertainty is that from one measurement (This is known as a ***reading***). This occurs when the reference point is pre-determined, such as $0\degree C$ in a thermometer.
#### Measurement
Two measurements occur when using equipment such as rulers or protractors, as you are measure the base point and the offset. Therefore the uncertainty is "$2\times$resolution".
#### Equipment Categories

| Reading            | Measurement      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| thermometer        | ruler            |
| top pan balance    | vernier calliper |
| measuring cylinder | micrometer       |
| digital voltmeter  | protractor       |
| Geiger counter     | stop watch       |
| pressure gauge     | analogue meter   |

## Combining Uncertainties
When doing "x" with values, the new uncertainty is:
### Adding & Subtracting
Add the [[Physics/Uncertainties/Absolute Uncertainty|Absolute Uncertainties]].
### Multiplying & Dividing
Add the [[Physics/Uncertainties/Percentage Uncertainty|Percentage Uncertainties]]
### Powers
Multiply the [[Physics/Uncertainties/Percentage Uncertainty|Percentage Uncertainties]]

## Reducing Uncertainty
[[Uncertainty|Uncertainty]] can be reduced by:

- Use equipment with a higher [[Resolution]]
- Repeat the experiment & calculate the mean average of this for your result.
