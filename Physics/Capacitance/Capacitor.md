# Capacitor
A [[Physics/Capacitance/Capacitor|Capacitor]] is an electrical component used to store charge.
They are made of two parallel conductive metal plates, often separated by a [[Physics/Capacitance/Dielectric|Dielectric]] material to ensure that the capacitor does not conduct the stored [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]].

Capacitors are measured in [[Physics/Capacitance/Capacitance|Capacitance]]. The most common capacitors are in the range of micro ($\mu$) to nano ($n$) [[Physics/Capacitance/Farad|Farads]].
