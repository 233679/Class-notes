# Capacitance
[[Physics/Capacitance/Capacitance|Capacitance]] is defined as "the [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]] stored per unit [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]]" and is measured in [[Physics/Capacitance/Farad|Farads]].

This is given by the formula "$C = \frac{Q}{V}$", where:
$C$ = [[Physics/Capacitance/Capacitance|Capacitance]]
$Q$ = [[Physics/Fields/Electrical/Charge|Charge]]
$V$ = [[Physics/Electricity/Potential Difference|Potential Difference]]
