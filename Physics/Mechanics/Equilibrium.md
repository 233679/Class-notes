# Equilibrium
An object is in [[Physics/Mechanics/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] if & only if the [[Physics/Mechanics/Resultant Force|Resultant Force]] action upon the object is zero. When an object is in [[Physics/Mechanics/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] the object will be moving at a constant [[Physics/Mechanics/Velocity|Velocity]] (which could be zero), as there is no [[Physics/Mechanics/Resultant Force|Resultant Force]] to accelerate the object.

When there are two forces acting upon an object, the object can only be in [[Physics/Mechanics/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] when the two forces are equal & opposite in direction & magnitude.
When there are three forces acting upon an object, the object can only be in [[Physics/Mechanics/Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] when the [[Physics/Mechanics/Resultant Force|Resultant Force]] of any of the two forces is equal & opposite to the third force.
