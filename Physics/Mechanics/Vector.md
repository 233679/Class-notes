# Vector
A [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]] is any physical quantity that has a direction & magnitude. An example of a [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]], is a distance in a constant direction ([[Physics/Mechanics/Displacement|Displacement]]).

### As Arrows
Any [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]] can be represented as an arrow on a [[Physics/Mechanics/Map Diagram|Map Diagram]] or [[Physics/Mechanics/Scale Diagram|Scale Diagram]]. With, the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]], & the direction of the arrow representing the direction of the [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]].

### Resultant Vector
Any two [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vectors]], that are the same type, can be combined on a [[Physics/Mechanics/Scale Diagram|Scale Diagram]], with [[Unsorted/Trigonometry|Trigonometry]] or Pythagoras, to get the resultant [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]].

#### Worked Examples

$Sin = \frac{O}{H}$
$Sin \times H = O$
$Sin(20) \times 8 = 2.7$kN
$2.7 \times 2 = 5.2$kN

For this example the above result is doubled, as there are two [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vectors]] of the same magnitude,
pulling the circle at an angle opposite to the other.

#### Example for Two Perpendicular Vectors

To find the resultant [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]], Pythagoras can be used.

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
$c = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{8^2+4^2} = 8.9$kn

#### Example for Parallel Vectors
However, if the two [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vectors]] are at 0 or 180 from each other the magnitude of each [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]] is summed up.

$10 + - 5 = 5$

### Un resolving vectors
It is also possible to have a "unresolved" vector (one that is not at 0, 90, 180, or 270). This can be resolved back into cardinal components by using trigonometry.

#### Worked example
![[Physics/Mechanics/Vector - Unresolving-Force-Diagram.png]]
To find the components of force F it will be draw as a right angle triangle like so.

Then to find the Opposite (Orange) & Adjacent (Pink) components trigonometry can be used.

To check that the answers are correct, Pythagoras can be used.
