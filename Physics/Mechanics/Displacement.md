# Displacement
[[Physics/Mechanics/Displacement|Displacement]] is distance in a constant direction.
[[Physics/Mechanics/Displacement|Displacement]] is a [[Physics/Mechanics/Vector|Vector]] quantity.

This diagram shows [[Physics/Mechanics/Displacement|Displacement]] & distance.
![[Physics/Mechanics/Displacement - Diagram.png]]
[[Physics/Mechanics/Displacement|Displacement]] is the blue line. It is the shortest route between point A & point B.
The green line is **a** route from A to B. If a person walked the green path, points A & B would still have the **displacement** of the blue path, but the **distance** the person travelled would be greater.
