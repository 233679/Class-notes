# Excitation
[[Physics/Practice/Excitation|Excitation]] is a process where an [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] collides with an [[Physics/Particles/Electron|Electron]] bound to an [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]] & causes it to move to a higher energy band, with the unbound electron expending a portion of its [[Physics/Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] to do so.
However, this process can only occur at certain energies known as **excitation energies**, which are unique to each [[Physics/Particles/Atom|Atom]].
