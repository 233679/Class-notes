# Elastic Deformation
[[Elastic Deformation]] is how much a material can deform & return to it's origin state. If a material is pushed past it's limits of [[Elastic Deformation]] then [[Plastic Deformation]] will occur.

In [[Elastic Deformation]], less energy will be dissipated than in [[Plastic Deformation]]. As the material returns most of the energy put into deformation.
